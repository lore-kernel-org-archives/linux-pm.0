Hi,

While wondering how come the ADC values don't match the charger
values and Android kernel values, I noticed few issues that
would be good to fix for v4.12-rc cycle.

Especially we should stick with the Android kernel name "usb"
for the charger as there's no need to break the compability
there.

The other issues are fixes for misconfigured charger hardware.

Regards,

Tony
