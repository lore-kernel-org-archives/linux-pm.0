Reworked as in: "there exist a dozen such boards in the world" or is
this an actually supported configuration that can be purchased?


The fact that you call this mezzanine "the BT-UART mezzanine" forces me
to assume that this isn't an actual product, prove me wrong please.

That's obvious.

But then you need to clearly describe what the difference between the
two boards is and model that in a clear way.
