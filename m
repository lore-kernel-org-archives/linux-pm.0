Good for me!

I would not introduce arch specific events. Your other proposal below
is more generic.

I am OK with that.

About pytimechart, I think it should be updated with the support for
the new events only. The current version is not perfect but supports
the current events correctly. I am planning to celan up and upgrade
that tool when the new API is out.

If that could force people to upgrade to the new events API asap...

I know you want to see real code. Let me come with a respin of the
patch asap (it is a matter of days).

Thanks,
Jean
