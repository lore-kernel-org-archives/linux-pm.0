No problem, things happen. The thing I'm worried about here
though is that these patches were "completely untested
clean-up patches" :) For the next set of changes like this,
please make sure you Cc the driver authors so they can test
and ack the changes if you can't test them, OK?

Well we have the merge window about to open in a week, so
please just revert the known broken patches.

Like I described, it looks all the non-regmap drivers with
read/write function pointers removed are broken now.

Just adding back the read/write function pointers while
keeping your other changes seems also risky to me at this
point. It seems it should work for twl4030 and twl6030
though, have not checked the other drivers but they seem
to have more changes.

Tony
