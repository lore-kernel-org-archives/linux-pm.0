Power down Thunderbolt controllers on Macs when nothing is plugged in
to save around 2W per controller.

Apple provides an ACPI-based (but nonstandard) mechanism to cut power
and signal hotplug during powerdown.  The usual way to implement such
nonstandard mechanisms seems to be a struct dev_pm_domain.
E.g. vga_switcheroo uses that for Optimus GPUs which control power
with ACPI DSMs.  Hence this third iteration of the series uses that
as well.  In v2 a more complicated approach was employed wherein power
control was exerted by a PCIe port service driver instead.

All the prep work went into 4.9 and 4.10, shrinking this series to just
7 patches:

- The actual "meat" of the series (to borrow a term from Bjorn) is in
  patches [6/7] and [7/7].  These two need an ack from Andreas.

- Patches [1/7] to [3/7] need an ack from Bjorn (and possibly Rafael or
  Mika).  They're fairly small and just add a bit to struct pci_dev
  signifying that a device is part of a Thunderbolt daisy chain, then
  use that bit to modify runtime PM for PCIe ports.  I'm also cc'ing
  Tomas and Amir at Intel Israel, if you guys have comments please shout.

- Patches [4/7] and [5/7] need an ack from Rafael.  Their sole purpose
  is to avoid a gratuitous WARN splat when assigning the struct
  dev_pm_domain.

I've pushed the patches to GitHub to ease reviewing/fetching:
