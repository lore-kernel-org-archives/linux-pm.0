Hi Kairui! Thanks a lot for the testing big boss :) I will focus on
the regression in this patch series - we can talk more about
directions in another thread :)

Interesting. Normally "lots of zero-filled page" is a very beneficial
case for vswap. You don't need a swapfile, or any zram/zswap metadata
overhead - it's a native swap backend. If production workload has this
many zero-filled pages, I think the numbers of vswap would be much
less alarming - perhaps even matching memory overhead because you
don't need to maintain a zram entry metadata (it's at least 2 words
per zram entry right?), while there's no reverse map overhead induced
(so it's 24 bytes on both side), and no need to do zram-side locking
:)

So I was surprised to see that it's not working out very well here. I
checked the implementation of memhog - let me know if this is wrong
place to look:

https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/memhog.8.html
https://github.com/numactl/numactl/blob/master/memhog.c#L52

I think this is what happened here: memhog was populating the memory
0xff, which triggers the full overhead of a swapfile-backed swap entry
because even though it's "same-filled" it's not zero-filled! I was
following Usama's observation - "less than 1% of the same-filled pages
were non-zero" - and so I only handled the zero-filled case here:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20240530102126.357438-1-usamaarif642@gmail.com/

This sounds a bit artificial IMHO - as Usama pointed out above, I
think most samefilled pages are zero pages, in real production
workloads. However, if you think there are real use cases with a lot
of non-zero samefilled pages, please let me know I can fix this real
quick. We can support this in vswap with zero extra metadata overhead
- change the VSWAP_ZERO swap entry type to VSWAP_SAME_FILLED, then use
the backend field to store that value. I can send you a patch if
you're interested.

Ohh interesting - I see that you're testing with MGLRU. I can give that a t=
ry.

I'm not enabling THP/mTHP, but I don't see that you're enabling it
either - there's some 2MB swpout but that seems incidental.

Another difference is the swap backend:

1. Regarding pmem backend - I'm not sure if I can get my hands on one
of these, but if you think SSD has the same characteristics maybe I
can give that a try? The problem with SSD is for some reason variance
tends to be pretty high, between iterations yes, but especially across
reboots. Or maybe zram?

2. What about the other numbers below? Are they also on pmem? FTR I
was running most of my benchmarks on zswap, except for one kernel
build benchmark on SSD.

3. Any other backends and setup you're interested in?

BTW, sounds like you have a great benchmark suite - is it open source
somewhere? If not, can you share it with us :) Vswap aside, I think
this would be a good suite to run all swap related changes for every
swap contributor.

Once again, thank you so much for your engagement, Kairui. Very much
appreciated - I owe you a beverage of your choice whenever we meet.
And have a great rest of your day :)
