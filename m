Humm, I did not quite get the point here, let's take fscrypt
for example, the kernel gets user generated key from user space,
and uses per-inode nonce(random bytes) as the master key to
do a KDF(key derivation function) on user provided key, and uses
that key for encryption. We can also added similar mechanism
to generate the key in kernel space but the key should be
original from user's provided key(password derived), because
the security boot/signature mechanism could not cover the case
that, two different users could resume to each other's context
because there isn't any certification during resume if it is
on the same physical hardware.

Best,
