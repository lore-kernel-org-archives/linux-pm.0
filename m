Have you tried on boards that need negative coefficients?

Keerthy,

The only thing I want you to confirm is if you are really getting the
negative coefficients, because currently of-thermal reads the array
using an OF helper that understands only unsigned. For this reason, I
will be queueing your patches only for next merge window, not as a fix,
not for rc's.
