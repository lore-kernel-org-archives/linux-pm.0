Right, but in the light of what you guys are saying about the
interactions between runtime suspend and resume I'm no longer clear that
that is actually sane for something which does use runtime PM, and of
course if a driver wants to support the wake configuration interface
then this might also fall out of the window.

Yeah, I think it is too.

So that's definitely safe?  I guess this partly comes back to the thing
I'm saying about how I'm finding all this stuff difficult to reason
about, every time I see such discussion I get confused about needing to
worry about it or not.
