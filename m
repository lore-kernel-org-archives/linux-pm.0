Well, from the initial comment in drivers/base/power/sysfs.c:

 *
 *    NOTE: The autosuspend_delay_ms attribute and the autosuspend_delay
 *    value are used only if the driver calls pm_runtime_use_autosuspend().
 *

Some drivers don't do that and they would be the primary target
audience for the new interface (if we agreed that it was useful after
all).

That certainly is correct and not limited to runtime PM. :-)

My understanding is that the idea would be to trigger an attempt to
suspend via a specific event (eg. lid closes) rather then via an
inactivity timer.

Thanks,
