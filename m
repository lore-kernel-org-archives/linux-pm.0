Yes I have these methods but I have no idea what they do. Just that
they have to be called before suspend:

Just tested your branch - works nicely (runtime pm, suspend and hibernate)!

Interesting. Looks like the NHI is really just a a device on the tb
swicht. But then it is understandable that turning it of does not
decrease power consumption.

I don't think that it is possible to tunnel into a different machine
like that :) The root port check should be sufficient.
