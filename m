... and I think I've found the problem.  In kernel/power/block_io.c,
in the function submit(), we see this:

	if (bio_chain == NULL) {
		submit_bio(bio_rw, bio);
		wait_on_page_locked(page);
		if (rw == READ)
			bio_set_pages_dirty(bio); <====
		bio_put(bio);

So when we read in pages from the software suspend device, we end up
marking the pages as dirty(!).  I'm guessing this was caused by a copy
and paste from the only other caller of bio_set_pages_dirty(), which
is the direct I/O code, which needs this when we are writing from a
file into a user-provided buffer.  But for restoring from a software
suspend case, this is as far as I can tell wholely inappropriate.

This causes needless writes, which is bad even before ext4 unmasked
the problem.  I will send a patch under separate cover; could you give
it a try and see if it fixes your crash?

I will look into bulletproofing ext4 by adding checks for this case
and printing warning messages, but neverthe less, I think the root
cause is actually in the hibernation's bio code.
