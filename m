Ok, can you give more informations about it, I don't see the connection
between screen resolution and cpuidle.

It would be interesting here to understand the root problem.

Can you give the cpuidle configuration (used governor and driver) ? If
you don't revert the patch but disable cpuidle (eg. cpuidle.off=3D1 or
don't compile it in the kernel), does the bug issue still occur ?

Thanks
