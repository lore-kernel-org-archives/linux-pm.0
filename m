I appreciate that!

Well, the problem in the ARM world is still the same as we had 10
years ago, just a bit different. While 10 years ago, the "make it work
for me" attitude was hidden in some vendor tree and stayed there
forever, today its still the same "make it work for me" thing which
gets applied to the vendor tree (they still sport 1000+ patches
despite all efforts) and then trickles into the mainline w/o much
review to fulfil the "we need to be mainline" mantra.

It was solely introduced to solve an oddball issue with the XEN "IPIs"
and I take the blame for not documenting it proper. Though I really
have a hard time to understand why random drivers use this w/o comment
and for no obvious reason. "Works for me" looks like a reasonable
explanation.

I've uploaded an incomplete and completely untested patch series to
handle this stuff to: https://tglx.de/~tglx/patches.tar

Feel free to pick it up and work from there.

Thanks,
