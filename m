Correct!

Before pm_runtime_reinit(), the failing probe case (-EPROBE_DEFER)
worked fine because the HW state and the runtime PM status was in
sync. The device was powered and the runtime PM status was RPM_ACTIVE.

Not correct. The hardware doesn't need a reset as it stays powered
after a failed probe.

Instead, only the runtime PM status needs to be synchronized with the
HW state the next probe attempt.

In other words, when the PM domain's ->runtime_resume() callbacks gets
called due to a pm_runtime_get_sync() in the second probe attempt, it
may find that the HW is already powered and can return zero instead of
resetting it.

Kind regards
