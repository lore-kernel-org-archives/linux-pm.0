This is arguing on a very thin line. In fact it is becoming pointless. 

Suppose there were an RSS-feed plugin that signals events to an event
Plugin. That event plugin could be either visual notification or sending
audio-signals. But the RSS feed doesn't know what specific plugin it
talks to. So screen off is _not always_ the right indicator. Sometimes
it is, sometimes it's not. 
There would be a seperate infrastructure needed in the program to tell
the different plugins that the core thinks everything should stop.
How does the core knows when to stop? And then there probably need to
be some kind of "suspend blockers" in the program. *g*

Just solve it at the right level, so that the apps don't need to be
infected with this shit. And this belongs between the iron and the
apps. And it seems it needs to be some cooperative approach of kernel
and userspace-framework as it isn't right to put that much policy in
the kernel.

I don't think it is a black and white thing, where you can just say
"fix the friggin apps". 

And this is a really f*beep*ng serious point. (at least to me)

Cheers,
Flo
