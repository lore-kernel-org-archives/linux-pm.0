Yes, that's my understanding too.

No, it isn't, because in that case there is no practical difference
between WAKE# and an in-band PME message sent by the device (Beacon)
from the software perspective.

WAKE# causes the switch to send a PME message upstream and that is
handled by the Root Complex through the standard mechanism already
supported by our existing PME driver (drivers/pci/pcie/pme.c).

OK

BTW, enable_irq_wake() should take care of the sharing, shouldn't it?

But the WAKE# thing is not just for waking up the system from sleep states,
it is for runtime PM's wakeup signaling too.

So we are fine except for the race and we need the wakeirq field in wakeup
sources to automatically arm the wakeup IRQs during suspend.

If I'm not mistaken, we only need something like the patch below (untested).

No worries. :-)
