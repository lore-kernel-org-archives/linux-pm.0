It is powered, but its runtime PM status does not reflect that, and that
is the problem. This patch makes sure that the child, and thereby
parent, are both runtime resumed throughout system suspend, but perhaps
that should be done explicitly in the parent driver as well (more
below).

Yes, in this example (the BBB has two OTG controllers), but it could
just as well be two controllers in peripheral mode where one is active.

Perhaps I read your question too literally above; I'm trying to explain
how you can end up with a runtime suspended parent during resume, without
hitting the external abort during suspend, with the current kernel.

This can be done by keeping the sibling/cousin controller enabled, but
could of course also have been achieved by preventing the grandparent
(omap) device (which controls the clock) from suspending by other means.

I'm just describing how this could happen with the current
implementation; I'm not claiming that the implementation is correct.

I think understand what you're getting at and yes, the parent *should*
be RPM_ACTIVE, while I'm saying that it *currently* is not guaranteed.

As mentioned above, this patch does make sure that child and parent are
both runtime resume when suspending and therefore remain RPM_ACTIVE
throughout suspend. This specifically means that the explicit activation
code on resume can now be removed.

But I should fix that paragraph and not blame the explicit activation
code for not "making sure that the parent was runtime resumed".

In fact, some of the parent glue drivers also do register accesses in
their suspend/resume callbacks which ought to have been preceded by an
explicit runtime resume. These glue drivers are a bit special however
and does check for a registered child in their pm callbacks so it's not
a problem in practise. I think I'll add them anyway for clarity in a
follow up patch.

Thanks,
Johan
