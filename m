I don't know what the best design is here.  I suspect that when we
resume, we should re-enumerate the PCI topology to see if anything
changed, but I don't think we do that.  I think there *is* something
like that for ACPI -- the BIOS can send a Bus Check notification on
resume if it knows something has changed.  But my guess is that if you
remove an adapter below a switch that is powered down because the
system is suspended, the interrupt we would normally get is lost
forever.

It doesn't seem like something that should be solved in the driver,
because you could just as easily have *added* a device while
suspended, and the core has to re-enumerate to find that.
