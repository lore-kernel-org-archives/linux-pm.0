Uggg. Please stop designing around the current OPP binding which has
the problem that the OPP table is not extensible to add more data.
Define a new OPP binding that solves these problems. This is at least
the 3rd OPP related binding addition I've seen recently. But I
wouldn't spend a lot of effort on a new OPP binding just to add the
functionality you are adding here because I don't like the whole
concept in general. This might be a common way to determine valid OPPs
on TI chips, but I think it is too low level and I don't want to see
bindings for every different possible way. Just add platform code to
do the OPP setup you need.

Frankly, I prefer the bootloader/firmware fixup the OPP table approach
mentioned in the cpufreq-cpu0 thread. Somewhat less desirable, but the
kernel could do the fixups as well (via of_update_property).
