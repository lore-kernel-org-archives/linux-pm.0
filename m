Ah, yes -- I see what's going on.  pm_runtime_put_sync() calls 
__pm_runtime_idle(), rather than __pm_runtime_suspend().  And the idle 
routine always forces RPM_AUTO on.

So what I said was wrong.  pm_runtime_put_sync() respects the driver's 
settings for autosuspend, whereas pm_runtime_put_sync_suspend() and 
pm_runtime_put_sync_autosuspend() override the settings.

Heh -- you are the person who did it.  :-)  See commit d66e6db28df3 
("PM / Runtime: Respect autosuspend when idle triggers suspend").

I guess the intention was that if the driver wants to specify whether 
autosuspend should be respected, it should implement an rpm_idle 
callback routine.
