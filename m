The MMC hardware will not get idled properly any longer blocking any
deeper idle states.

It probes fine after a -EPROBE_DEFER on the vmmc i2c regulator.
But the PM runtime usecounts are wrong.

Right.

Correct.

That seems to be the case here. In device driver probe, commenting out
pm_runtime_set_autosuspend_delay(host->dev, MMC_AUTOSUSPEND_DELAY)
also makes things work again.

So one of the failing cases seems to be:

1. Device driver probe sets pm_runtime_set_autosuspend_delay()

2. Device driver probe initially fails with -EPROBE_DEFER

3. PM runtime usecounts get messed up

Correct. It uses the notifiers like bus code does in general.

FYI, most SoCs don't have hardware based autoidle signaling between
the interconnect and the interconnect targets. So the hwmod code is
still needed until we have converted it into a proper interconnect +
module target drivers.

It has worked since pm runtime. And it works with MMC as as a loadable
module just fine when no -EPROBE_DEFER happens.

Not correct. I think that speculation is not related to the $subject
regression at all.

BTW, do you have some hardware to test with that has PM runtime
implemnted and actually working with mainline kernel?
