Thanks for looking that up.

If I understand correctly it was removed because we do not expect BIOS
to put buses to B2/B3 so we do not need to wait the extra 50ms before
accessing the device.

However, now that we do that in the OS (and also during runtime), I
think we need to take that into account again.
