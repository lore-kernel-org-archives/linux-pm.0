I linked to the mails from Kevin...  To be honest I'm rather surprised
this stuff is getting exposed directly to userspace with write support.

Well, clearly that's not the only use - demand for increased energy
consumption by itself from users is generally quite low :)

Coming at this from the embedded perspective modifying the kernel just
isn't an issue.  It's quite depressing in other cases too but some of
the circumstances you mentioned in previous messages are sensible do
make sense to me.  It does seem like this is a system specific problem
which we should be able to enable as part of the support for those
systems.

If it were a debugfs facility I'd not be concerned.

My experience has been that once you start providing an interface people
will find it, start using it and it takes a lot of work to convince them
that they ought to do something better.  This is totally reasonable from
when you look at things from their point of view, especially people who
aren't used to being able to improve anything except their own driver.

That's not really a problem - if people are adding their own crazy
interfaces it's clear that they've done that.  It'll show up as a red
flag to anyone looking at their stuff and this will create pressure on
them to fix their code or at least do a better job for the next thing.

The goal isn't to tie people's hands to stop them doing silly things,
it's to make it clear that that is what they're doing.
