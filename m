That's not about my ambition or lack thereof, but about avoiding introducing
regressions on systems that are not Apple because of the ambition to be as
good as Apple.

And I'm not even talking about this particular piece of code, but about the
other code that calls pci_update_current_state().

Sorry for disappointing you.

I have concerns, so I talk about them.  Is that wrong?  If so, what's wrong
about it?

My time goes into that as well, mind you.

OK

Which as I said in the other message I've just sent, if you use
acpi_device_get_power() for that, it will only report D3cold if (a) the device
has a _PR3 and (b) the power resources configuration in there indicates D3cold.

Does that cover the Thunderbolt case even?

Thanks,
Rafael
