It is a trade off to derive the key in user space, we once
tried to derive the key in user space, and people suggested
a better way is to do it in user space. And there is a similar
user case of kernel using key from user space is derived from ecryptfs
for ext4.

The only difference between Chun-Yi's hibernation encrytion solution
and our solution is that his strategy encrypts the snapshot from sratch, 
and ours encryts each page before them going to block device. The benefit
of his solution is that the snapshot can be encrypt in kernel first
thus the uswsusp is allowed  to read it to user space even kernel
is lock down. And I had a discussion with Chun-Yi that we can use
his snapshot solution to make uswsusp happy, and we share the crypto
help code and he can also use our user provided key for his signature.
>From this point of view, our code are actually the same, except that
we can help clean up the code and also enhance some encrytion process
for his solution. I don't know why you don't like encryption in kernel, 
because from my point of view, without encryption hibernation in kernel,
uswsusp could not be enabled if kernel is lock down : -) Or do I miss something?
Best,
Yu
