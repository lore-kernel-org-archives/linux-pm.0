Linux 4.8 added support for runtime suspending PCIe ports to D3hot with
commit 006d44e49a25 ("PCI: Add runtime PM support for PCIe ports"), but
excluded hotplug ports.  Those are now afforded runtime PM by the
present commit.

Hotplug ports require a few extra considerations:

- The configuration space of the port remains accessible in D3hot, so
  all the functions to read or modify the Slot Status and Slot Control
  registers need not be modified.  Even turning on slot power doesn't
  seem to require the port to be in D0, at least the PCIe spec doesn't
  say so and I confirmed that by testing with a Thunderbolt controller.

- However D0 is required to access devices on the subordinate bus.  This
  happens in pciehp_check_link_status() and pciehp_configure_device()
  (both called from board_added()) and in pciehp_unconfigure_device()
  (called from remove_board()), so acquire a runtime PM ref for their
  invocation.

- The hotplug port stays active as long as it has active children.  If
  all hotplugged devices below the port runtime suspend, the port is
  allowed to runtime suspend as well.  Plug and unplug detection
  continues to work in D3hot.

- Hotplug interrupts are delivered in-band, so while the hotplug port
  itself is allowed to go to D3hot, its parent ports must stay in D0 for
  interrupts to come through.  Add a corresponding restriction to
  pci_dev_check_d3cold().

- Runtime PM may only be allowed if the hotplug port is handled natively
  by the OS.  On ACPI systems, the port may alternatively be handled by
  the firmware and things break if the OS puts the port into D3 behind
  the firmware's back:  E.g. Thunderbolt hotplug ports on non-Macs are
  handled by Intel's firmware in System Management Mode and the firmware
  is known to access devices on the port's subordinate bus without
  checking first if the port is in D0:
