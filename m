These patches make a number of improvements to twl4030_charger.

So are just internal cleanups (e.g. use of devres).  Others allow
better control of charging through both manual and automatic means.

- the maximum current can be configured via sysfs.
- the charger will only draw that current if it can do so without
  the voltage dropping too much
- a 'continuous' mode is available which ignores voltage and just
  takes what it can (to be used with caution, but very useful in
  some circumstances).
- 'ac' and 'usb' power sources can be configured separately.

Some of this functionality requires patch to phy-twl4030-usb.c which
have been sent separately.

Thanks,
NeilBrown

NeilBrown (15):
      power_supply core: support use of devres to register/unregister a power supply.
      twl4030_charger: use devm_request_threaded_irq
      twl4030_charger: use devres for power_supply_register and kzalloc.
      twl4030_charger: use runtime_pm to keep usb phy active while charging.
      twl4030_charger: trust phy to determine when USB power is available.
      twl4030_charger: split uA calculation into a function.
      twl4030_charger: allow fine control of charger current.
      twl4030_charger: distinguish between USB current and 'AC' current
      twl4030_charger: allow max_current to be managed via sysfs.
      twl4030_charger: only draw USB current as negotiated with host.
      twl4030_charger: enable manual enable/disable of usb charging.
      twl4030_charger: add software controlled linear charging mode.
      twl4030_charger: add ac/mode to match usb/mode
      twl4030_charger: Increase current carefully while watching voltage.
      twl4030_charger: assume a 'charger' can supply maximum current.
