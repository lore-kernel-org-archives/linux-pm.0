With the main difference that their semantics and API is defined by the
lower layer so that the lower layer can make useful - for the
multitasking part - scheduling decisions.
There were other forms of multitasking before preemptive multitasking -
coroutines (e.g. in Win-3.x quite late in IT history) and the like.
So why not simply skip one step in evolution and go more directly to a
useful solution?
