The other vendors appear to be managing nicely without magic blockers. I
conjecture therefore there are other solutions.

This is why I am trying to understand the problem properly.

The existing implementation has been comprehensively rejected by half the
x86 maintainers and scheduler people to start with. That's a fairly big
'No'.

Ted save the politicing and blame mongering for management meetings
please.

If we don't have a solution it means that between us we couldn't find a
viable solution. Maybe there isn't one, maybe we missed it. It's as much
'google rejects kernel approach' as 'kernel rejects google approach' and
more importantly its actually 'we (cumulative) were not smart enough
between us to figure it out'

In some cases it is easier to do stuff yourself than work with others.
One of the conditions of working in a public space is that you do so
without harming others. This is why in much of the western world you can
drive a car around your own land without a licence but must have one to
drive on a public road. This is why a restuarant must meet different food
standards to a home kitchen. This is why the kernel standards are higher
than what you go off and do in private.

Android is a very unique and extremely narrow environment. If it really
is special enough to need its own kernel fork it isn't the first case for
that and it's not a problem. The GPL is quite happy to encourage this.
Time will then answer the questions because in 3 years time either every
non Google phone will be kicking butt without suspend blockers, or every
phone vendor using Linux with a traditional user space will be demanding
them.
