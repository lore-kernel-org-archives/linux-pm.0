I left the thing running for the weekend and it failed 26 out of 16057
times with the 25ms timeout. Looks like it takes ~5 minutes to resume
when it fails, but eventually it does come back.

My hunch would be that SMM trap in the DSDT/SSDT since that's where
things ended up last time I was tracing these resume problems. Though I
can't recall if that was just with acpi-idle or if intel_idle landed in
the same spot as well.

I guess I can try to repeat that test tomorrow, or I'll try your function
tracer method if the other thing fails.
