Hello Arve,

I regret the delay in responding.

I see.  You are referring to wakeup event loss/delay caused by the full=20
system suspend process (e.g., kernel/power/suspend.c:enter_state()=20
onwards[1]), correct?  This message addresses this at the end of the mail.

Consider a suspending system in which all "untrusted" processes have been=
=20
placed into TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE state and have had their timers=20
disabled.[2] The only remaining work to do on the system is work that=20
needs to be done as part of the suspend process, or work that is part of a=
=20
"trusted" process or the kernel.  If the suspend needs to be aborted due=20
to the arrival of an event, this can be handled as part of the standard=20
suspend process (described below).

> When should the system wake up?

I suspect that I am misunderstanding your question, but the system should=
=20
wake up the same way it does now: when a wakeup interrupt arrives (either=
=20
from the next scheduled timer expiration, or from some external device).

Any driver should be able to abort suspend by returning an error from its=
=20
struct device_driver/struct dev_pm_ops suspend function.  Consider this=20
partial callgraph for full system suspend, from [3], [4]:

   kernel/power/suspend.c:   enter_state() ->
   kernel/power/suspend.c:    suspend_devices_and_enter() ->
drivers/base/power/main.c:     dpm_suspend_start() ->
drivers/base/power/main.c:      dpm_suspend() ->
drivers/base/power/main.c:       device_suspend() ->
drivers/base/power/main.c:        __device_suspend() ->
drivers/base/power/main.c:         pm_op() ->
drivers/base/power/main.c:          ops->suspend()

If ops->suspend() returns an error, it's ultimately passed back to=20
suspend_devices_and_enter(), which aborts the suspend[5].

In this context, the main change that should be necessary is for=20
driver/subsystem suspend functions to return an error when there are=20
events pending.  For example, as an alternative to the Android series'=20
evdev.c patch[6], the evdev.c suspend function could return an error such=
=20
as -EBUSY if events are currently queued (example below).

Aborting suspend in the event of driver activity seems like the right=20
thing to do in a system that attempts to enter full system suspend while=20
idle.  But it is not the current expected Linux behavior, which also seems=
=20
useful.  Any abort-suspend-if-busy behavior should be configurable.  One=20
way would be to add a sysfs file for each driver/subsystem: perhaps=20
something like 'abort_suspend_if_busy'.  The default value would be zero=20
to preserve the current behavior.  Systems that wish to use opportunistic=
=20
suspend could write a one to some or all of those files.

An untested, purely illustrative example, based on evdev.c, is at the end=
=20
of this message.  It's not meant to be functional; it's just meant to=20
demonstrate the basic idea in code form.

=2E..

Like suspend-blockers, adding abort_suspend_if_busy support would require=
=20
changes throughout many drivers and subsystems.  However, unlike=20
suspend-blockers, the above abort_suspend_if_busy approach would not=20
introduce any new APIs[7], nor would it change the default suspend=20
behavior of the system.

As an aside, it seems that Android shouldn't currently need this if it's=20
possible to pause "untrusted" processes and timers[8], since current=20
shipping Android hardware can enter the same system low power state both=20
with and without full system suspend[9].  But this could be useful for=20
non-Android systems that still wish to use an idle-loop based,=20
opportunistic full system suspend.


regards,

- Paul
