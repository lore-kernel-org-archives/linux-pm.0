This is all nice but, all this does is implement the exact same thing as
the wake lock / suspend blocker API as a pm_qos request-class.  It
leaves the overlapping constraint issue from ISR to user mode in place
depending on exactly how the oppertunistic suspend is implemented.

I expect it will be via a notifier on the pm_qos request-class update
that would do exactly what the wake lock code does today.  just load up
an a "suspend_on_non_interactivity" driver that registers for the call
back, have it enabled by the user mode PM, and you have the equivelent
architecture as what was proposed by the wake lock patches.

it gives the Android guys what they want, without adding a new
subsystem, minimizing the changes and makes most of the architecture
much more politicaly acceptible.

But doesn't it have the same issues with getting the overlapping
constraints right from wake up source to user mode and dealing with the
wake up envents in a sane way?  Instead of sprinkling suspend-blockers
about the kernel we'll sprinkle pm_qos_requests about.  I like getting
more users of pm_qos, but isn't this the same thing?

I don't think the status would be a big deal to add.


However; I am really burned out by this discussion.  I am willing to
stub this out ASAP if it puts this behind us if the principles in the
discussion are in more or less agreement.

For the record, I still like my low power event idea, which could
coexist with the above.
