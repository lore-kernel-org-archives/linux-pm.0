So this works, because we power up the device during resume even if it
had been suspended (via runtime PM) before the suspend started.

And here we try to leave the device alone which is OK for devices in D0,
but not for suspended ones.

It looks like we need to power up them at the "thaw" time too or at least
I don't see how to address that differently.

OK, thanks so much for getting to the bottom of this!
