Something like that.

I don't see how that would work, but might be worth trying.
After doing that, a simple flush_workqueue() might be enough
to take care of the suspend operation.

Yes, either that, or use set_bit/test_bit/test_and_set_bit for
atomic access. For instance, this one

        if (mq->flags & MMC_QUEUE_NEW_REQUEST) {
                mq->flags &= ~MMC_QUEUE_NEW_REQUEST;

Could be

	if (test_and_clear(MMC_QUEUE_NEW_REQUEST_BIT, &mq->flags))
			...
