I agree with Peter, this part of the patch was the hardest to read.
SCHED_WARN_ON line makes sense to me. The condition that follows and
the following comment are a little baffling. Condition seems to
indicate that the code that follows should be executed only if we are
in the top-most occupied bucket (the bucket which has tasks and has
the highest uclamp value). So this bucket just lost its last task and
we should update rq->uclamp[clamp_id].value. However that's not
exactly what the code does... It also resets
rq->uclamp[clamp_id].bucket[bucket_id].value. So if I understand
correctly, unless the bucket that just lost its last task is the
top-most one its value will not be reset to nominal value. That looks
like a bug to me. Am I missing something?

Side note: some more explanation would be very helpful.
