What I meant was that various keypad controllers provide different options.
For one TC35893 keypad controller I know, it allows putting the keypad modu=
le
into the deepest low power mode while enabling the keypad module to wakeup
via a combination of specific keys. In such a case, the user space isn't ev=
en going
to get events to ignore.

Okay. I messed up the kicking part; but why should the device solely wait =

for an auto suspend timer to expire. Don't you agree that the keypad module =

be turned off when a keypad slider is pushed back into a phone?

Yes not always; but examples of keypads, touch panels could.

Hmm. I was looking at the case with touch screen. I set my display backlight
to go off after say 30 seconds; my touch screen idle begins only when the d=
isplay
goes off; meaning I still expect the touch screen to respond to any events =
before
the timeout. This in turn requires that the timeouts for the backlight and =
the touch
be synchronized, failing which the user might interpret the touch to be non=
-functional
in case the touch timeout and backlight timeout vary. Am I wrong to think t=
hat
such inter-dependency between devices should be avoided?

Agree.

Oh am sorry again; my bad choice of words :( I didn't intend to settle that=
 as
the final outcome). Well the idea of accelerated suspend too looks promisin=
g.

Also, for some of the keypad behavior, apart from Dmitry's replies,

The examples that I can see are truly low power states; the STMPE/TC35893(o=
r X)
and ones have the ability to disable the keypad clocks and as explained abo=
ve ability
to either come back to active mode via magic key presses or some host activ=

the usual MFD.

As Dmitry replied, there are variations possible. Controllers part of a MFD=
 group
usually allow returning to active mode via specific bus transactions betwee=
n the
MFD host and the CPU; dedicated controllers on SoCs cannot wakeup via thems=
elves;
but some dedicated GPIO lines wakeup the CPU and in turn the CPU can wake u=
p the
controller and etc etc

Cheers!
