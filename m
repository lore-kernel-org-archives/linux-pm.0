Not directly, for example, omap device framework has noirq callback implemented
which forcibly disable all devices which are not PM runtime suspended.
while doing this it calls drivers PM .runtime_suspend() which may return
non 0 value and in this case device will be left enabled (powered) at suspend for
wake up purposes (see _od_suspend_noirq()).
