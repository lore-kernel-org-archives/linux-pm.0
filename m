"You" were talking about PCs. Some of us are interested in the making

I don't believe the Android one does either. It maybe handles a subset in
a specific case.

I would point you at the web, cgi scripts and the huge Linux server farms
fielding billions of hits per second on crap cgi scripts.

That doesn't mean the Android one is the right approach. Nobody has
explained to me how you don't get synchronization effects in Android or
indeed answered several of the questions pointing out holes in the
Android model. The fact we are at rev 8 says something too - that the
Android 'proof' isn't old or tested either !
