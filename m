You are right that this compatible didn't exist in DT and I never claimed that
it does.

Both Rob, you and devicetree lists were CCed to the series and there were
reviews from Rob for multiple patches in that series too. So I interpreted his
absence of reviews on other patches in the series as silent Acks.

Here, the driver is just creating compatible for a real device. What difference
does it make if the BT node was defined statically in the DT vs created
dynamically? Both nodes do represent a real BT device, not driver's own
representation. And by the time the node was created, the device is physically
attached to the system.
