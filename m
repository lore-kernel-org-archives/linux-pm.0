Including Tianyu's stuff?

No.

The controller can't suspend until the root hub is suspended.  Did you 
check the various runtime status values for the root hub, its 
interface, and Tianyu's new port devices?

In Greg's usb-next branch, the port devices are disabled for runtime
PM.  But if you are testing Tianyu's new patches then they aren't.  
They could be preventing your root hubs from suspending.
