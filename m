What you say sounds good, assuming that the cost of a sleep is less than 
the cost of the busy wait. But this may be hardware, the waits may be 
very small and frequent, and if it's hitting a small hardware window 
like retrace, delays in response will cause the time period to be missed 
completely. This probably less critical with very smart cards, many of 
us don't run them.
