Hello,

some comments on the kernel-level suspend blocker API.

Another problem with the suspend-block kernel API is that its primary=20
use-case[1] is to work around the brokenness of patch 1's opportunistic=20
suspend governor.  The governor is broken because it intentionally ignores=
=20
timers and the scheduler.  To work around problems caused by this=20
decision, suspend-blocks must be spread throughout the kernel (and=20
userspace) to restore the previous behavior of the system.  But if patch=20
1's opportunistic suspend governor were fixed, most of the need for a=20
suspend blockers would disappear.

[ This E-mail expands on some earlier comments[2] and is also related
  to other opportunistic suspend comments[3]. ]

The suspend-block patches require already-working code to be patched to=20
keep it working.  This is a backwards approach.  Instead, broken code=20
should be patched to fix the brokenness.  But the former approach is=20
exactly what the suspend block API is intended to do.  Patches 7 and 8 in=
=20
this series are two clear cases.  Patch 7 adds an ioctl to the input=20
subsystem that will cause the system to stay running as long as there is=20
an event in the event queue.  Patch 8 adds a suspend-block call to the=20
power_supply code that causes the system to stay running as long as=20
power_supply's changed_work workqueue has work to do.  Neither of these=20
patches should be needed, since the default expectation of the mainline=20
Linux kernel is that the system should run when there is work to be done.

This longstanding expectation should be preserved, not broken and then=20
patched around.  But since patch 1 violates that expectation, there is no=
=20
choice but to add patches 7 and 8 -- and ultimately many more patches --=20
to get a working system.  Once the opportunistic suspend governor in patch=
=20
1 is introduced and enabled, the kernel will suspend the system=20
immediately, even if the system has work to do.  The only way to prevent=20
that is to add suspend-blocks.

Many suspend blocks will be needed throughout the kernel to keep things=20
working.  One might think that patches 7 and 8 are the only changes needed=
=20
to get a working Android-style opportunistic suspend system.  It turns out=
=20
that many more changes are needed.  This can be seen by looking at=20
currently shipping Android kernels, such as the current current Android=20
'msm' kernel tree[4]. Suspend-blocker usage is spread through many drivers=
=20
and subsystems:

[paul@twilight msm]$ fgrep -r wake_lock . | egrep '(^./drivers|^./arch)' |=
=20
cut -f1 -d: | sort -u
=2E/arch/arm/mach-msm/htc_battery.c
=2E/arch/arm/mach-msm/pm.c
=2E/arch/arm/mach-msm/qdsp5/adsp.c
=2E/arch/arm/mach-msm/qdsp5/audio_out.c
=2E/arch/arm/mach-msm/smd_qmi.c
=2E/arch/arm/mach-msm/smd_rpcrouter.c
=2E/arch/arm/mach-msm/smd_rpcrouter.h
=2E/arch/arm/mach-msm/smd_rpcrouter_servers.c
=2E/arch/arm/mach-msm/smd_tty.c
=2E/drivers/i2c/chips/mt9t013.c
=2E/drivers/input/evdev.c
=2E/drivers/input/misc/gpio_input.c
=2E/drivers/input/misc/gpio_matrix.c
=2E/drivers/mmc/core/core.c
=2E/drivers/net/msm_rmnet.c
=2E/drivers/rtc/alarm.c
=2E/drivers/serial/msm_serial_hs.c
=2E/drivers/usb/function/mass_storage.c
=2E/drivers/usb/gadget/f_mass_storage.c
=2E/drivers/video/msm/mddi.c
=2E/drivers/video/msm/msm_fb.c

I guess this is something like what kernel developers should eventually=20
expect to see if suspend blockers are merged.

There is a better way to make the system work as expected: these patch 1=20
shouldn't break general timer and scheduler assumptions.  If patch 1's=20
governor is fixed, most of these calls will be unnecessary.  The apparent=
=20
motivation is to prevent "untrusted" userspace processes from preventing=20
the system from entering a low-power state.  I agree that this is a=20
problem.  But it should be fixed by modifying the specific Linux code that=
=20
determines when the idle loop is entered and when the next timer wakeup=20
should occur, on a per-process basis.  Such targeted changes would ensure=
=20
that the rest of the kernel would continue to execute as expected.

regards,

- Paul
