So, in fact, you don't like the _idea_, because the _idea_ is to use suspend
blockers instead of trying to define what "idle" means.

I don't think it's generally possible to define "idle" to match every possi=
ble
criteria one can imagine, so you're request to do that simply cannot be
satisfied.

That's because the point is not to suspend when the system is "idle", becau=
se
that would mean "suspend transparently from the applications' point of view=
",
which is what the Android people _don't_ _want_ _to_ _do_, because in that
case their battery life would go to the toilet.  The idea is to suspend even
when the system is not techincally "idle" and you don't like _that_.

That depends on the maintainers of these subsystems, who still have the pow=
er
to reject requested changes.

As I said before, I don't think there's a way to resolve this so that every=
one
is happy and in my opinion there are reasons to merge the feature.

Also I don't think we can make any progress discussing it.  We've already
discussed it for a month or so without any real progress and I don't see how
that's going to change now.

Thanks,
Rafael
