Looks good to me. I've also tested those here and seems to work fine.

I agree with your reasoning that the patch should not be needed anymore.
However, I have the machine which needed that patch at home so I'm not
able to test it now. I'll do that later today when I get back home.

One thing I noticed, though. When a bridge is transitioned to D0 we only
wait for 10ms which is requirement for PCI functions. However, PCI PM
specification 1.2 (chapter 4.2) requires that for buses to transition
from B2 to B0 we need to wait minimum of 50ms before accessing a
function on that bus.

We even have PCI_PM_BUS_WAIT defined in include/linux/pci.h but it is
not used anywhere. Maybe it was not needed originally because we never
powered down bridges anyway but now when we do, I think it is good idea
to do what the spec requires.

What do you think? We could add a separate patch doing something like
below to make sure the spec is followed.
