So, how does this look?

It looks to me like you have cca 0.1 Ohm resistance in your system,
and are using cca 75mA while discharging, and charge by cca 1.4A. (And
these are all the coefficients the code should need; rest is battery
characteristics -- common to all li-ions, and charger characteristics
-- that will be common to all cellphones. If current can be measured,
this code should go more precise answers).

It is tricky to do a good job near 0%... or anywhere else. See for
example

http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~trosing/lectures/battery.pdf

You start a call, percentage goes down, end a call, it will go
back up. I'm pretty sure you will not be able to make a call with "5%"
indication from your code at low battery temperature (say -10C).

Anyway, see above, I think I provide reasonable values even in that ran=
ge.
