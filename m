You're right, good point.  How about disabling runtime PM then, like this:

	/* Fast path for suspended devices */
	if (pm_runtime_status_suspended(dev) && (!drv || !drv->shutdown) &&
	    !kexec_in_progress) {
		pm_runtime_disable(dev);
		if (pm_runtime_status_suspended(dev))
			return;
		pm_runtime_enable(dev);
	}

All dependents (children, and in the future, consumers) should already
have been treated at that point, due to the ordering of devices_kset->list.

Thanks!

Lukas
