I'm not thinking of anything in particular.  Just brainstorming...

If somebody decides to freeze userspace without putting the entire 
system to sleep, how will they know when to unfreeze?  A certain amount 
of specialized kernel/userspace interaction would be needed.

Then those two are almost the same thing.  It doesn't seem to make much 
sense to say "I want to stop these processes from running now, but 
allow them to run if one of them gets a timer or I/O signal".

Once userspace is inactive, the kernel probably doesn't have very much
to do.  Responding to some network packets, maybe, if the network
interfaces are left running (like a router but without support for
dynamic routing protocols).  In general, I don't think a system could
do a whole lot of useful work in such a state.

This is more of a "transition" issue than a "steady-state" concern.  
When userspace is frozen, it can't generate new I/O requests.  If the 
old ones were left to terminate normally, pretty soon the I/O queues 
would drain by themselves.

In short, I'm not sure how these ideas would yield anything new and 
worthwhile.  Maybe I'm just slow today...
