Thanks for checking this out!

My suggestion:

  - Open a bug report at bugzilla.kernel.org, Drivers/PCI component,
    attach "lspci -vv" output for entire system.

  - Reorganize your diff above as a "final" quirk that updates
    dev->pme_support and puts a note in dmesg.  I think this could go
    in arch/x86/pci/fixup.c since I think this is only possible on
    x86.

  - Include the bug URL, errata URL, and "Description" and "Potential
    Effect on System" text in your changelog.
