It is not just a driver matching problem, but ensuring that we properly describe
the BT device in DT. Since the BT interface of the M.2 device is not
discoverable, we are currently using the PCIe IDs of the M.2 device to create
the BT node dynamically under UART node using OF_DYNAMIC as proposed in this
patch which got merged already [1]. Then we also create the serdev device and
allow the existing BT hci_qca driver to probe and make use of the created DT
node.

Since each BT device is unique, the compatible used in the dynamic node needs to
be documented in the binding. But there is no need to describe any supplies or
BT_EN GPIOs since they are already part of the M.2 binding.
