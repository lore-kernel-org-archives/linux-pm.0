Well, excuse me, but I don't get it.  Why would I need to write any board code
for an ACPI-based system?

Interrupts that can wake up from the "freeze" sleep state need not be set up
with enable_irq_wake() and the flag doesn't say "this is a wakeup interrupt".
It says "do not suspend this interrupt, I can handle it after the device has
been suspended" (as I said).

And if it is OK for a driver to set IRQF_SHARED, it is equally OK for it to
set IRQF_NO_SUSPEND, because, in fact, those two flags are related.

I'm not sure whose idea it was that IRQF_NO_SUSPEND was not to be set by drivers,
but it is not a correct one.  I know why suspend_device_irqs() was introduced
and I'm telling you this has nothing to do with setting up the IRQ chip to do
system wakeup.

And please grep for IRQF_NO_SUSPEND to see how drivers generally use it.
