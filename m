Yes, any user space key helper must be authenticated for secure boot
(or the kernel locked-down mode).

If user choices the user space helper, then they should awares that
this approach can not be trusted when kernel is in locked-down mode.
The user space helper be protected by IMA/EVM, or the initrd be
authentricated with trusted boot.

The user space key helper is useful when the machine doesn't have
TPM or EFI firmware, but user still wants to use the hibernation
encryption/verification.

For kernel locked-down mode, EFI key or trusted key TPM can be
trusted because they can only be created/visibled in kernel space.
