Those devices have no standard power state definitions.

The problem you have here really is PCI-specific, because you want to
use PCI PM along with the non-standard methods.

struct dev_pm_domain is way too generic for that though, as I'm sure
there are users of it where the can_power_off thing wouldn't make any
sense whatever.
