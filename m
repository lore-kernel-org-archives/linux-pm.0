The problem lies in the definition of the goal and means to achieve it.
We do rely on repositories to discriminate on the quality of applications.
As I stated some are accessible and run by our community.

So, in this scenario, it works well enough.

What I consider plain wrong i to claim that since there are this many 
units out, some code should be merged.
A company needs to cut corners sometimes when making a product but this 
should not affect upstream code.

That's very good. But if it is done in a conceptually flawed way, some 
better solution should be considered for upstream merge.

Sure.

I simply disagree on the methods proposed (suspend_blockers) and some of 
the rationale used for promoting them (volume of otherwise unsupported 
units).
