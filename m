Hi Linus,

Please pull from

 git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rafael/linux-pm.git \
 pm+acpi-4.5-rc6-1

to receive the first batch of power management and ACPI updates for
v4.6-rc1 with top-most commit 0d571b62dd8eb341788599259c3dbc92c0dc8f22

 Merge branch 'pm-tools'

on top of commit b562e44f507e863c6792946e4e1b1449fbbac85d

 Linux 4.5

This time the majority of changes go into cpufreq and they are
significant.

First off, the way CPU frequency updates are triggered is different
now.  Instead of having to set up and manage a deferrable timer for
each CPU in the system to evaluate and possibly change its frequency
periodically, cpufreq governors set up callbacks to be invoked by the
scheduler on a regular basis (basically on utilization updates).  The
"old" governors, "ondemand" and "conservative", still do all of their
work in process context (although that is triggered by the scheduler
now), but intel_pstate does it all in the callback invoked by the
scheduler with no need for any additional asynchronous processing.

Of course, this eliminates the overhead related to the management
of all those timers, but also it allows the cpufreq governor code to
be simplified quite a bit.  On top of that, the common code and
data structures used by the "ondemand" and "conservative" governors
are cleaned up and made more straightforward and some long-standing
and quite annoying problems are addressed.  In particular, the
handling of governor sysfs attributes is modified and the related
locking becomes more fine grained which allows some concurrency
problems to be avoided (particularly deadlocks with the core cpufreq
code).

In principle, the new mechanism for triggering frequency updates
allows utilization information to be passed from the scheduler to
cpufreq.  Although the current code doesn't make use of it, in the
works is a new cpufreq governor that will make decisions based on the
scheduler's utilization data.  That should allow the scheduler and
cpufreq to work more closely together in the long run.

In addition to the core and governor changes, cpufreq drivers are
updated too.  Fixes and optimizations go into intel_pstate, the
cpufreq-dt driver is updated on top of some modification in the
Operating Performance Points (OPP) framework and there are fixes
and other updates in the powernv cpufreq driver.

Apart from the cpufreq updates there is some new ACPICA material,
including a fix for a problem introduced by previous ACPICA updates,
and some less significant changes in the ACPI code, like CPPC code
optimizations, ACPI processor driver cleanups and support for
loading ACPI tables from initrd.

Also updated are the generic power domains framework, the Intel
RAPL power capping driver and the turbostat utility and we have a
bunch of traditional assorted fixes and cleanups.

Specifics:

 - Redesign of cpufreq governors and the intel_pstate driver to
   make them use callbacks invoked by the scheduler to trigger CPU
   frequency evaluation instead of using per-CPU deferrable timers
   for that purpose (Rafael Wysocki).

 - Reorganization and cleanup of cpufreq governor code to make it
   more straightforward and fix some concurrency problems in it
   (Rafael Wysocki, Viresh Kumar).

 - Cleanup and improvements of locking in the cpufreq core (Viresh
   Kumar).

 - Assorted cleanups in the cpufreq core (Rafael Wysocki, Viresh
   Kumar, Eric Biggers).

 - intel_pstate driver updates including fixes, optimizations and a
   modification to make it enable enable hardware-coordinated P-state
   selection (HWP) by default if supported by the processor (Philippe
   Longepe, Srinivas Pandruvada, Rafael Wysocki, Viresh Kumar, Felipe
   Franciosi).

 - Operating Performance Points (OPP) framework updates to improve
   its handling of voltage regulators and device clocks and updates
   of the cpufreq-dt driver on top of that (Viresh Kumar, Jon Hunter).

 - Updates of the powernv cpufreq driver to fix initialization
   and cleanup problems in it and correct its worker thread handling
   with respect to CPU offline, new powernv_throttle tracepoint
   (Shilpasri Bhat).

 - ACPI cpufreq driver optimization and cleanup (Rafael Wysocki).

 - ACPICA updates including one fix for a regression introduced
   by previos changes in the ACPICA code (Bob Moore, Lv Zheng,
   David Box, Colin Ian King).

 - Support for installing ACPI tables from initrd (Lv Zheng).

 - Optimizations of the ACPI CPPC code (Prashanth Prakash, Ashwin
   Chaugule).

 - Support for _HID(ACPI0010) devices (ACPI processor containers)
   and ACPI processor driver cleanups (Sudeep Holla).

 - Support for ACPI-based enumeration of the AMBA bus (Graeme Gregory,
   Aleksey Makarov).

 - Modification of the ACPI PCI IRQ management code to make it treat
   255 in the Interrupt Line register as "not connected" on x86 (as
   per the specification) and avoid attempts to use that value as
   a valid interrupt vector (Chen Fan).

 - ACPI APEI fixes related to resource leaks (Josh Hunt).

 - Removal of modularity from a few ACPI drivers (BGRT, GHES,
   intel_pmic_crc) that cannot be built as modules in practice (Paul
   Gortmaker).

 - PNP framework update to make it treat ACPI_RESOURCE_TYPE_SERIAL_BUS
   as a valid resource type (Harb Abdulhamid).

 - New device ID (future AMD I2C controller) in the ACPI driver for
   AMD SoCs (APD) and in the designware I2C driver (Xiangliang Yu).

 - Assorted ACPI cleanups (Colin Ian King, Kaiyen Chang, Oleg Drokin).

 - cpuidle menu governor optimization to avoid a square root
   computation in it (Rasmus Villemoes).

 - Fix for potential use-after-free in the generic device properties
   framework (Heikki Krogerus).

 - Updates of the generic power domains (genpd) framework including
   support for multiple power states of a domain, fixes and debugfs
   output improvements (Axel Haslam, Jon Hunter, Laurent Pinchart,
   Geert Uytterhoeven).

 - Intel RAPL power capping driver updates to reduce IPI overhead in
   it (Jacob Pan).

 - System suspend/hibernation code cleanups (Eric Biggers, Saurabh
   Sengar).

 - Year 2038 fix for the process freezer (Abhilash Jindal).

 - turbostat utility updates including new features (decoding of more
   registers and CPUID fields, sub-second intervals support, GFX MHz
   and RC6 printout, --out command line option), fixes (syscall jitter
   detection and workaround, reductioin of the number of syscalls made,
   fixes related to Xeon x200 processors, compiler warning fixes) and
   cleanups (Len Brown, Hubert Chrzaniuk, Chen Yu).

Thanks!
