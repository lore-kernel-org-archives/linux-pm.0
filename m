It's not clear how drivers will benefit.

Drivers don't have to implement anything special if they want to use
their runtime routines for system suspend.  All they have to do is set
the .suspend and .resume method pointers to point to their
runtime_suspend and runtime_resume routines.

The reason for doing things the way they are is to avoid races between
system PM callbacks and runtime PM callbacks.  We don't want to have a
runtime_resume routine powering up a device at the same time as a
suspend routine is powering it down.
