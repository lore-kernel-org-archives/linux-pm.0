BTW., I like the series otherwise: for example in my comment above I wrote up the 
SYM_FUNC_START()/END() names from memory, without having to look up the 
primitives.

[ Then I double checked it from the series to make sure I got it right. ;-) ]

Before this I could never remember all these random, idiosyncratic, path dependent 
macro names - now there's at least some good high level structure to them. So it's 
a good step forward.

Thanks,
