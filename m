So?

What exactly is wrong with having empty ops in there?

Is it really better to have everyone do extra checks every time an op is
invoked even when all of the ops are present?

Change it in one patch and move it around in another one and you'll be less
likely to make a mistake.  Moreover, reviewing it will be easier too, IMO.
