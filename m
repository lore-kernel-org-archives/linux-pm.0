Respin of this series to polish the runtime PM support for PCIe ports
that was added with v4.8, and extend it to native hotplug ports:

- All patches have been reviewed by Rafael, patches 1 to 8 have been
  tested by Mika.  (Thanks a lot!)

- Patch 6 ("PCI: Unfold conditions to block runtime PM on PCIe ports")
  contains a minor change relative to v1 wherein the function returns
  as soon as a single condition evaluates to true.  (Instead of
  needlessly evaluating all the remaining conditions.)

- Patch 9 was rebased to accommodate to this change but is otherwise
  the same as before.

As usual I've pushed the series to GitHub to ease reviewing/fetching:

Thanks,
