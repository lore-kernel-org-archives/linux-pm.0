right, the idea was to move clock handling away from that, because that
has been creating a few issues for drivers the biggest of which is the
fact that we can't know, by probe() time, if the device is active or
suspended. Ideally, by probe() the device would be fully active with is
runtime pm usage counter incremented so that the first pm_runtime_get*
in our probe() doesn't try to call ->runtime_resume().
