Hi Shawn, just started looking at this myself, and as Frank Sorensen points
out in https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1209143 the problem is
that a task takes the xprt lock and then ends up in the refrigerator
effectively blocking other tasks from proceeding.

Jeff, any suggestions on how to proceed here?

Ben
