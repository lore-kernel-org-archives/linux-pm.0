The new error lines are (from the bugzilla attachment):

  i915 0000:00:02.0: BAR 6: [??? 0x00000000 flags 0x2] has bogus alignment

Using "radeon.runpm=0" gets rid of the radeon MPS complaints, but not
the others.

Alex said (in the bugzilla):

I haven't looked into this at all, so I don't know where this bug
report belongs.
