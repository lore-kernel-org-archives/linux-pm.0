These are two different things, Ran.
udelay is a way to put simple delay between two functions. The cpu
will continue to perform other operations in a multithreded platform.

CPUIdle sleep states are mainly to achieve power saving by programming
cpus to difference states depending on how much time (estimated) a cpu
is going to be idle with algorithm. So each state will have latency
associated with it - enter, exit latency. If the cpu idle time falls
within any of C-state's latency that will be programmed. In different
state cpu will be programmed with different modes to achieve diff
power saving.

System Wake up can be achieved by programming a wakeup source such as keypad.
