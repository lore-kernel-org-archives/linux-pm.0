AFAIK Windows started to enable runtime PM (RTD3) for native PCIe
hotplug ports with the latest release (I guess it's the RS3 release) but
only when there is a special ACPI _DSD property ("HotPlugSupportInD3")
associated with the root port. I think we can take advantage of that in
Linux as well and I already have a patch series to enable runtime PM for
such ports but I haven't been able to test it properly yet.
