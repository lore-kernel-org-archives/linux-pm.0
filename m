Ideally this should not be called C0, but expressed
as (#define) POLL_IDLE wherever possible.

In all documentations/specs/white papers about other OSes
C0 is refered to as not being idle.
Linux mis-uses it as a self-defined idle state which
is really confusing.

I would use a special number for the "Linux only" state.

It's not only that, my patch also:
  - eleminates the never ever used type= field
  - uses a better name, currently it's power:power_{start,end}
    How would you name another power event...

Altogether, it should justify the proposed cleanup(s).
But with this C0 clash, I am not sure whether:
  1) as Ingo said any clean up
  2) a minimal cleanup:
       - rename power:power_{start,end} to power:processor_idle{start,end}
       - get rid of type= field
  3) or a maximum cleanup:
       - plus not use start/end events, but use one state transition
         event.
should be done.
I think best is Jean goes with current definitions.
2. is far less intrusive and if you like to have it, I can
still send another patch.
