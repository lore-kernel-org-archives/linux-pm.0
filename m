No, I'm talking about the rq::uclamp::bucket[clamp_id][], which is an
array of:

   struct uclamp_bucket {
	unsigned long value : bits_per(SCHED_CAPACITY_SCALE);
	unsigned long tasks : BITS_PER_LONG - bits_per(SCHED_CAPACITY_SCALE);
   };

defined as part of:

   struct uclamp_rq {
	unsigned int value;
	struct uclamp_bucket bucket[UCLAMP_BUCKETS];
   };


So, it's an array of UCLAMP_BUCKETS (value, tasks) pairs.

Right, the comment above refers to the default configuration, which is
5 buckets. With that configuration we have:


$> pahole kernel/sched/core.o

---8<---
   struct uclamp_bucket {
           long unsigned int          value:11;             /*     0:53  8 */
           long unsigned int          tasks:53;             /*     0: 0  8 */

           /* size: 8, cachelines: 1, members: 2 */
           /* last cacheline: 8 bytes */
   };

   struct uclamp_rq {
           unsigned int               value;                /*     0     4 */

           /* XXX 4 bytes hole, try to pack */

           struct uclamp_bucket       bucket[5];            /*     8    40 */

           /* size: 48, cachelines: 1, members: 2 */
           /* sum members: 44, holes: 1, sum holes: 4 */
           /* last cacheline: 48 bytes */
   };

   struct rq {
           // ...
           /* --- cacheline 2 boundary (128 bytes) --- */
           struct uclamp_rq           uclamp[2];            /*   128    96 */
           /* --- cacheline 3 boundary (192 bytes) was 32 bytes ago --- */
           // ...
   };
---8<---

Where you see the array fits into a single cache line.

Actually I notice now that, since when we removed the bucket dedicated
to the default values, we now have some spare space and we can
probably increase the default (and minimum) value of UCLAMP_BUCKETS to
be 7.

This will uses two full cache lines in struct rq, one for each clamp
index...  Although 7 it's a bit of a odd number and gives by default
buckets of ~14% size instead of the ~20%.

Thoughts ?
