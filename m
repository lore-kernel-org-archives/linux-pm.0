Pretty much, although the devices would not listen to events
themselves but rather there will be an entity listening for various
events and requesting certain devices to quiesce themselves in
response for such events.

We are not planning on implementing the policy in kernel, that's
indeed task for userspace; but unless we bring in the heavy hammer of
forcibly unbinding drivers, we do not currently have universal
mechanism of quiescing devices.
