But not the kind of insight we need.  See below.

Perhaps.

Okay, and the kernel never suspends.  We _are_ talking about a kind of
forced suspend, right?

No, it won't.  That's the problem suspend blockers were meant to solve.  
The event winds up sitting in a kernel queue, the PM core doesn't know
about it (that's what I meant above -- the PM core doesn't know as much
as you seem to think it does), and the suspend takes place regardless.

It would be okay if that happened.  But once the event gets into the
kernel and the hardware IRQ source has turned off, there's nothing to
cause the resume.

Agreed.  Badly behaved apps must not be allowed to block suspends.  As 
far as I'm concerned, we can ignore them.
