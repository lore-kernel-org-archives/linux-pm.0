There's an additional complication that I'd guess the wakeup is 
typically a GPIO line and hence a different parent. We have 2 options 
there. The first is interrupts-extended which is generally implicitly 
supported (i.e. we only document interrupts). The second is we already 
have interrupt-map if we have legacy interrupts and can map to different 
parents. For this to work, we'd have to use a number >4 for the wakeup 
interrupts.
