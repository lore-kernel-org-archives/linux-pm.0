Ulf, please be more careful about the distinction between "device" and 
"driver".  Devices don't have callbacks; drivers do.  You made this 
mistake a few times in the patch description.

The same thing that happens whenever any PM-related callback is defined
by both the subsystem and the driver: The PM core uses the subsystem's
callback.  (Or the pm_domain's callback, or the type's callback, or the 
class's callback.)

Besides, Ulf specifically assumed at the top of this message that
re-using the runtime-suspend callback makes sense at the subsystem
level.  This must mean it is appropriate for all drivers in the
subsystem.  So why would a driver want to override the subsystem's 
behavior?

Another possibility is to have the pm_generic_suspend_late_runtime
routine check to see if the driver has defined a suspend_late callback.  
If the driver has its own callback, we could invoke it instead of
invoking the runtime_suspend callback.

However, I'm not sure that doing this would be worthwhile.  And it
would hang in an infinite loop if the driver set its suspend_late
pointer to pm_generic_suspend_late_runtime!
