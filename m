Yes and no...  stick a bunch of USB hubs and devices
on the system, and you may have a lot of wake events.
Keyboard, mouse, network adapter, and so on.

 Way back when I made USB remote wakeup work, ISTR running
into a version of the issue you're raising.  Briefly, the
wake event could be queued in hardware, but there were also
various unavoidable races .... with ambiguity about just when
particular events should be recognized.  If the system entered
sleep before the wake event(s) triggered, or the relevant devices
suspended first, then things were clear; otherwise, not.  On
first blush, I'd expect every hardware wake mechanism would have
the same issues; the fact that USB wakes are mediated via khubd
is not a huge difference.
