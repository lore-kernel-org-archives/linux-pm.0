I don't know what ACPI methods you're calling, but (as I'm sure you
know) it's not guaranteed to be safe to call random methods because
they can make arbitrary changes to the system.

I skimmed through [1], but I'm not sure I understood everything.
Here's what I gleaned; please correct any mistaken impressions:

  1) Suspend/resume is mentioned in [1], but the problem occurs even
without any suspend/resume.
  2) The problem happens on a completely stock untainted upstream
kernel even with no nvidia, nouveau, or i915 drivers loaded.
  3) Disabling the nvidia device (02:00.0) by executing an ACPI method
works fine, and the system works fine after the nvidia device is
disabled.
  4) This ACPI method puts the nvidia device in D3cold state.
  5) Problems start when enabling the nvidia device by executing
another ACPI method.

In the D3cold state, the PCI device is entirely powered off.  After it
is re-enabled, e.g., by the ACPI method in 5) above, the device needs
to be completely re-initialized.  Since you're executing the ACPI
method "by hand," outside the context of the Linux power management
system, there's nothing to re-initialize the device.

This by itself shouldn't be a problem; the device should power up with
its BARs zeroed out and disabled, bus mastering disabled, etc.

BUT the kernel doesn't know about these power changes you're making,
so some things will be broken.  For example, while the nvidia device
is in D3cold, lspci will return garbage for that device.  After it
returns to D0, lspci should work again, but now the state of the
device (BAR assignments, interrupts, etc.) is different from what
Linux thinks it is.

If a driver does anything with the device after it returns to D0, I
think things will break, because the PCI core already knows what
resources are assigned to the device, but the device forgot them when
it was powered off.  So the PCI core would happily enable the device
but it will respond at the wrong addresses.

But I think you said problems happen even without any driver for the
nvidia device, so there's probably more going on.  This is a video
device, and I wouldn't be surprised if there's some legacy VGA
behavior that doesn't follow the usual PCI rules.

Can you:

1) Collect complete "lspci -vvxxx" output from the whole system, with
the nvidia card enabled.
2) Disable nvidia card.
3) Collect complete dmesg log.
4) Try "lspci -s02:00.0".  I expect this to show garbage if the nvidia
card is powered off.
5) Enable nvidia card.
6) Try "lspci -vvxxx" again.  You mentioned changes to devices other
than nvidia, which sounds suspicious.
7) Collect dmesg log again.  I don't expect changes here, because the
kernel probably doesn't notice the power transition.
