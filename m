Yeah, this is a little messy.  If I can get into 4.2, that would be nice,
but not required -- arm64 already has a usable patch for now, and that's
the only arch affected.  So, 4.3 was my primary target (which is why I
worked with linux-next for these).

Which tree?  Yeesh.  1/5 and 5/5 are ACPI only and required for the rest
to work properly; 2/5 is arm64, 3/5 is ia64, and 4/5 is x86.  ARM folks are
the only ones to have provided acks or reviews, however.  I guess I was
assuming this would have to go in via Rafael's ACPI tree since those are
the key parts -- the arch-specific patches would remove safety checks on
MADT subtables without replacing them, if they went in before the ACPI
patches.

Does that make sense?  What do you think?
