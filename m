The code in dd.c assumes that the device being probed has no children
(or consumers, for that matter) and so it is safe to move it to the
end of the list.

If the device has children (or consumers), moving it to the end of the
list by itself doesn't work, which is the case for you.

You can't do this here.

It is not clear why all PCI devices should be an exception in the
first place.  There may be PCI devices without children that need to
be moved to the end of the list and you'd break that case.

You can try to replace the device_pm_move_last(dev) in
deferred_probe_work_func(struct() with device_reorder_to_tail(), but
that has to be called under device_links_read_lock/unloc () and
device_pm_lock/unloc() (in the right order).
