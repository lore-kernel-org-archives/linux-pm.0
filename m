It will mean that the same API is used for blocking suspend in
regular suspend/resume, runtime PM runtime_suspend/runtime_resume
and now also suspend blockers, right? So only one code path for
drivers that want to support both, no?

That'll be a bit more elegant for drivers that want to support
both runtime PM and suspend blockers I believe.

Overall as a driver writer I'm quite confused at this point, if
I have a driver X, how is that code going to look if it is going
to support both runtime PM *and* suspend blockers? I don't say
it has to support both mechanisms in parallell, I'm even fine
with putting it in #ifdef:s, but how will the source code look?
A real-world example on a simple driver out of the Motorola Droid
git or so would help a lot.

It's quite relevant since e.g. all OMAP drivers will need this
modification to be used with Android-like systems, and at
ST-Ericsson we will need both runtime PM and suspend blockers for
our drivers as well. It will as a consequence affect the drivers
for all ARM reference boards since we use the drivers for ARM
PrimeCells. etc...

Now if this mechanism is going in, my main interest is that there
is some clearly cut way and design pattern for supporting both
runtime PM and suspend blocks.
