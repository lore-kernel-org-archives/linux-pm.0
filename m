USB uses a similar approach.  Hot-unplugs are handled by the khubd 
thread, which is freezable and therefore doesn't run until after the 
system is resumed.

In the USB stack, the subsystem core resume code checks to see if a
device has been unplugged before the driver's ->resume callback is
invoked.  If a device is gone, the driver callback is skipped.  Thus
drivers don't have to worry about trying to resume a device that has
been unplugged.
