The pin to side-band signal a plug event is not present on Light Ridge
(and presumably Light Peak), only on Eagle Ridge and newer (2011+).

The pins for power control (Force Power, Go2Sx, Ok2Go2Sx) are not present
on Light Ridge and Eagle Ridge, only on Cactus Ridge and newer (2012+).

In other words, Thunderbolt controllers had no power control built in
before Cactus Ridge.  If you've only seen chips which have the plug event
pin then you've only seen newer chips. ;-)

Actually, never mind.  It occurred to me that we only allow hotplug ports
to suspend in pci_bridge_d3_possible() if they're handled natively by the
OS, which is only the case on Macs.  On non-Macs the hotplug ports block
their parent ports from suspending by virtue of staying in D0 all the time.
Thus it's meaningless whether or not they block their parent ports from
suspending in pci_dev_check_d3cold().

So the patch is safe, I just forgot all this context because I wrote it
months ago.  I've now amended the commit message with this background
information.

Thanks,

Lukas
