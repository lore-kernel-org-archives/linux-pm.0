Indeed. And usually it is not "Addidional flags" - its mandatory cell for
 the most of IRQ controllers.

The problem with hard-coded IRQ trigger type values in code is that on
different boards IRQ can be wired on different way - to the GIC/INTC,
to SoC GPIO, to GPIO expanders and .. And they can support different sets
of allowed IRQ triggering types. More over, on some boards IRQ signal can be
inverted, for example :P

So, It's more generic to not hard-code it if your driver is expected to be
used only with DT.
Also as per TRM http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps65217.pdf
nINT - interrupt output (active low, open drain). Pin is pulled low if an interrupt bit is set. The
       output goes high after the bit causing the interrupt in register INT has been read.
       The interrupt sources can be masked in register INT, so no interrupt is generated when the
       corresponding interrupt bit is set
