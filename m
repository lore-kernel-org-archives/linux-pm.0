This is a nouveau-specific driver problem that is triggered by the
adding runtime PM support for PCIe ports.

That would indeed be a regression, please see this nouveau patch series
for a suggestion:
https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/nouveau/2016-May/025116.html

By the way, there is also currently a RPM refcounting issue in nouveau
(possibly fixed by
https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/nouveau/2016-May/025107.html)
which resulted in the following problem:

 1. Initially RPM refcount is 1 when no driver is loaded for a device.
 2. Load nouveau which will RPM suspend the device. refcount becomes 0.
 3. Unload nouveau (bug: refcount stays 0).
 4. As a result, the PCIe ports are runtime suspended (should probably
    not happen as there is no bound driver).
 5. When nouveau is loaded again, the power resources are enabled again,
    *but* it does not put the device into D0 (it expected that this was
    already the case). (with ACPI debugging on I see that _PS0 is not
    called).
 6. As a result, reading registers failed, "unknown chipset (ffffffff)"
    is printed to dmesg and the probe fails.

(Maybe the PCI core should have a WARN when the RPM is "auto" and the
refcount drops below 1 after remove is called with no driver left?)

Kind regards,
Peter Wu
