Going to low power needn't involve the power subsystem?  That sounds 
weird.

So my next question is: _How_ can this help PM to do a better job?  
That is, what are the mechanisms?

One you have already stated: Lack of spurious events will help prevent 
unwanted wakeups (or unwanted failures to go to sleep).

But Dmitry made a stronger claim: Inhibiting an input device should 
allow the device to go to low power.  I would like to know how we can 
implement this cleanly.  The most straightforward approach is to use 
runtime PM, but it's not obvious how this can be made to work with the 
current API.
