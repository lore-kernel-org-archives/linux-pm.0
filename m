The RPM_FASTPATH approach turns out not to be viable.  It clearly
implies that some calls will be made with the flag and some calls will
be made without.  This can lead to incorrect behavior.

Here's what can happen.  Suppose the device is at low power and CPU 1
calls pm_runtime_resume without using the new flag.  An instant later,
a remote wakeup interrupt arrives and the interrupt handler on CPU 2
calls pm_runtime_resume with the new flag set.

Since CPU 1 has changed the status to RPM_RESUMING, CPU 2 has to wait
until the resume has completed, and since CPU 2 is in_interrupt, it has
to busy-wait.  But the process it's waiting for is running on CPU 1
with interrupts enabled and so can block for an arbitrarily long time.

This example shows that if _any_ resume callbacks are made in_interrupt
then they _all_ have to be made with interrupts disabled.  The same
sort of reasoning applies to suspend callbacks (replace RPM_RESUMING 
above with RPM_SUSPENDING).

Given this, I see no point in adding a special per-call flag.

There's another advantage to using a per-device flag.  Not all resume
calls are initiated by the driver; the PM core has to start a resume on
its own when rpm_resume sees that the device's parent is suspended.  
When this happens, the nested resume can be carried out with interrupts
disabled if the parent's driver supports it -- and the PM core won't
know that unless there's a flag for it in dev_pm_info.
