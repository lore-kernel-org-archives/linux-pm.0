We currently perform a mandatory runtime resume of all PCI devices on
->shutdown.  However it is pointless to wake devices only to immediately
power them down afterwards.  (Or have the firmware reset them, in case
of a reboot.)

It seems there are only two cases when a runtime resume is actually
necessary:  If the driver has declared a ->shutdown callback or if kexec
is in progress.

Constrain resume of a device to these cases and let it slumber
otherwise, thereby conserving energy and speeding up shutdown.
