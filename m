I don't understand the reason to why you need to skip invoking resume
callbacks to achieve this behavior, could you elaborate on that?

Couldn't the PM domain or the middle-layer instead decide what to do?
To me it sounds a bit prone to errors by skipping callbacks from the
PM core, and I wonder if the general driver author will be able to
understand how to use this flag properly.

That said, as the series don't include any changes for drivers making
use of the flag, could please fold in such change as it would provide
a more complete picture?

Yeah, clearly the PM core needs to be involved, because of the need of
dealing with parent/child relations, however as kind of indicate
above, couldn't the PM core just set some flag/status bits, which
instructs the middle-layer and PM domain on what to do? That sounds
like an easier approach.

According to the doc, the DPM_FLAG_LEAVE_SUSPENDED intends to leave
the device in runtime suspend state during system resume.
However, here you are actually trying to change its runtime PM state to that.

Moreover, you should check the return value from
pm_runtime_set_suspended(). Then I wonder, what should you do when it
fails here?

Perhaps a better idea is to do this in the noirq suspend phase,
because it allows you to bail out in case pm_runtime_set_suspended()
fails.

Another option is to leave this to the middle-layer and PM domain,
that would make it more flexible and probably also easier for them to
deal with the error path.
