The PM core was unconditionally preventing devices from being runtime
suspended during system suspend. The reason is that we don't want
asynchronous runtime suspends to happen during system suspend and thus
race with the system suspend process, which some drivers and buses are
not able to handle.

However, for drivers that don't have issues with the races above, are
somewhat suffering from the constraints this cause and then need to
inactivate their devices outside the runtime PM control during system
suspend. In other words, those implements .suspend|suspend_late
callbacks to handle this.

To simplify for these drivers, we add new runtime PM API,
pm_runtime_no_prevent_suspend(), which drivers typically should call
from their probe routines to tell PM core that it must not prevent
runtime suspend during system suspend. Additonally the PM core will
in this case instead invode the pm_runtime_idle just before it shall
disable runtime PM in suspend_late.

Drivers making use if this feature are then able to trigger runtime
suspend with for example a pm_runtime_put_sync from their .suspend
callbacks. Additionally, for drivers that are able to cope with only
runtime PM callbacks, these can rely on the PM core to trigger a
runtime suspend (if the runtime PM usage count doesn't prevent it)
to inactivate their devices during system suspend.

Some discussion started recently while I posted below patch:
[RFC PATCH] PM / Runtime: Allow to inactivate devices during system suspend

After some thinking I decided to cook another RFC, that might be better
material for discussion. If we decide to go in this direction, the doc
obviously needs some update as well, which is not a part of this RFC yet.
