I'm sure you've considered this, but I can't figure out whether this
patch will reintroduce the problem that was solved by 52cdbdd49853.
That patch updated two places: (1) really_probe(), the change you're
reverting here, and (2) device_move().

device_move() is only called from 4-5 places, none of which look
related to the problem fixed by 52cdbdd49853, so it seems like that
problem was probably resolved by the hunk you're reverting.
