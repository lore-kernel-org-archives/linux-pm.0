It should still be valid.  After all, there's nothing else to set the
flag except for other parts of the PCI core.

It's not difficult in theory to tie together the WoL setting and the
wakeup flag:

	If ethtool changes the WoL setting, the driver's ioctl handler
	should make the corresponding change to the wakeup flag.

	If ethtool queries the WoL setting, the ioctl handler should
	check the wakeup flag.  If the flag is off, it should report 
	that WoL is disabled; if the flag is on, it should report that 
	WoL is enabled.  (The same check should be made in the suspend
	routine.)

All right, we can declare that network drivers are allowed to enable
WoL by default (like keyboard drivers).  There shouldn't be any problem
provided they initialize the wakeup setting before registering the
network interface, so that the initialization doesn't override any 
action by udev.

As I described above.

Well, clearly there's a difference if the user _doesn't_ run ethtool.  
Apart from that, it's okay.
