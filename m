That _is_ the main difference, and it's a big one.  (As Magnus pointed 
out, wakeup-enabling is another difference).

They don't have to be decoupled, and indeed they can share code.  The 
point Rafael and I are making is that they have to use different 
callback pointers, which gives you a chance to handle the differences 
as well as the similarities.

Assuming the wakeup setting is correct, and assuming you use the same 
power level for runtime suspend and system suspend, then nothing needs 
to be done.

If the wakeup setting is not correct, it has to be changed.  That 
often implies going back to full power in order to change the 
wakeup setting, then going to low power again.

This is all described in various files under Documentation/power/, in 
particular, devices.txt and runtime_pm.txt.

No, it's generally agreed that _all_ devices should return to full 
power during system resume -- even if they were runtime suspended 
before the system sleep.  This also is explained in the Documentation 
files.

You could test priv->flags here instead.  But I suppose this would
work.

No, you shouldn't call the PM core here.

At this point you should call magic_device_set_low_power(dev).  That
routine can also be shared with runtime PM.

I don't see any point in having separate flags for system suspend and 
runtime suspend.  Just use MY_DEVICE_IS_SUSPENDED, and set it in the 
magic_device_set_low_power routine.

This should simply be:

	magic_device_set_full_power(dev);  // clears MY_DEVICE_IS_SUSPENDED
	magic_device_enable(dev);
