Well that was just based on what I see in the dmesg:

omap_device: omap_device_enable() called from invalid state 1

Here's with use count dumped for one MMC:

omap_hsmmc 4809c000.mmc: GPIO lookup for consumer cd
omap_hsmmc 4809c000.mmc: using device tree for GPIO lookup
omap_hsmmc 4809c000.mmc: Got CD GPIO
omap_hsmmc 4809c000.mmc: GPIO lookup for consumer wp
omap_hsmmc 4809c000.mmc: using device tree for GPIO lookup
omap_hsmmc 4809c000.mmc: using lookup tables for GPIO lookup
omap_hsmmc 4809c000.mmc: lookup for GPIO wp failed
omap_hsmmc 4809c000.mmc: GPIO lookup for consumer cd
omap_hsmmc 4809c000.mmc: using device tree for GPIO lookup
omap_hsmmc 4809c000.mmc: Got CD GPIO
omap_hsmmc 4809c000.mmc: GPIO lookup for consumer wp
omap_hsmmc 4809c000.mmc: using device tree for GPIO lookup
omap_hsmmc 4809c000.mmc: using lookup tables for GPIO lookup
omap_hsmmc 4809c000.mmc: lookup for GPIO wp failed
omap_hsmmc 4809c000.mmc: omap_device: omap_device_enable() called from invalid state 1
omap_hsmmc 4809c000.mmc: PM runtime use count: 0

So it seems you're right, it's the state not the count.

No nothing is setting that from userspace.

Yes I think you're right here, it's the state, not the count.

We certainly see a warning there.

Yup.

That might explain the warning above.

OK good to hear. Anyways, getting an omap3 should be in tens of
whatever units if you need one to test with.

Now that would be good to have in the mainline kernel. Of course it
still is a very limited test.
