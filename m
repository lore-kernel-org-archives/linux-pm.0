OK... This seams to me, still a corner case supposed to be fixed at
orderly_power_off, not at thermal. But..

>=20

Given that system running hot is a thermal issue, I guess we care more
on this matter then..

The above is not a kernel doc entry...

Why not calling kernel_power_off() directly instead? That is what is called=
 by orderly
power off in case it fails, which seams to be  the missing part when
user land returns success, and therefore we don't call
kernel_power_off(). That path goes through the machine_power_off(),
which seams to be the default for pm_power_off() anyway.

kernel_power_off() handles the power off system call too.

Shouldn't we start count the timeout before calling orderly_poweroff?
