I disagree and think that both are quite realistic (mainly because they
exist today, albiet mostly out of tree because no generic QoS framework
exist.  e.g. on OMAP, we have OMAP-specific *kernel* APIs for requesting
per-device wakeup latencies, and drivers and frameworks are using them.)

Most of these frameworks already have QoS constraints/requirements but
have no generic way to express them.  That's why we're pushing for a
generic constraints framework.

Consider video for example.  It's the kernel-side drivers, not user
space apps, that know about the latency or throughput constraints based
on e.g. frame rate, bytes/pixel, double/triple buffering, PIP, multiple
displays, etc. etc.   

In this case, the video framework (V4L2) might not want any knobs
exposed to userspace because userspace simply doesn't have the knowledge
to set appropriate constraints.  I'm less familiar with audio, but I
believe audio would be similar (sample rate, number of channels, mixing
with other concurrent audio streams, etc. etc. are all known by the
kernel-side code.)

On the other hand, consider touchscreen.  Touchscreens have a
configurable sample rate which allows a trade-off between power savings
and accuracy.  For example, low accuracy (and thus low power) would be
fine for a UI which is only taking finger gestures, but if the
application was doing handwriting recognition with a stylus, it would
likely want higher accuracy (and consume more power.)

In this case, the kernel driver has no way of knowing what the
application is doing, so some way for touchscreen apps to request this
kind of constraint would be required.

My point is it should be up to each framework (audio, video,
input/touchscreen) to expose a userspace interface to their users that
makes sense for the *specific needs* of the framework.

Using the above examples, audio and video might not need (or want) to
expose anything to userspace, where touchscreen would.  IMO, it would be
much more obvious for a touchscreen app to use a new API in tslib (which
it is already using) to set its constraints rather than having to use
tslib for most things but a sysfs file for QoS.

As stated above, because for many frameworks userspace simply does not
have all (or any) of the knowledge to set the right constraints.
