Right, the switchtec device puts all its management MMIO registers 
behind a separate PCIe function which lets us bind a different driver 
and not conflict with the portdrv. I've noticed the PLX parts have an 
extra unused BAR in their upstream port function which means it will be 
an annoying hack to write a driver to use it seeing the portdrv needs to 
be registered to it.
