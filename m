Yes

The thing to note about hibernation is that there is a regular boot in
between saving the hibernation image and restoring it again.  At boot time,
the kernel knows almost nothing about whether there is a hibernation image
and whether or not it will be restored.  Consequently it becomes difficult
to avoid mmc_rescan().  As mentioned above, we need mmc_rescan() to
initialize the eMMC so that the hibernation image can be read.
