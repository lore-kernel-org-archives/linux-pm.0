I believe we can and do mark devices such as USB as wakeup capable on
other arches, you do not have control here. That is why I am uneasy with
doing this in input core.

Is there any keys that are not autorepeating. For example regular
(non-OLPC) laptops usually do not repeat suspend and other special keys.
In fact, they quite often forget to send release events for them ;)

Much appreciated, sorry for being a pain.
