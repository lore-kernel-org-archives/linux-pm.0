Hi Linus,

Please pull from the git repository at

 git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rafael/linux-pm.git \
 pm+acpi-3.14-rc3

to receive ACPI and power management fixes for v3.14-rc3
with top-most commit 465e5fc41dbeeb5331bbff6e9e734f0542dfc739

  Merge branch 'pm-cpufreq'

on top of commit b28a960c42fcd9cfc987441fa6d1c1a471f0f9ed

  Linux 3.14-rc2

These include a fix for a recent intel_pstate regression, a fix for
a regression in the ACPI-based PCI hotplug (ACPIPHP) code introduced
during the 3.12 cycle, fixes for two bugs in the ACPI core introduced
recently and a MAINTAINERS update related to cpufreq.

Specifics:

 - Fix for a recent regression in the intel_pstate driver that
   introduced a race condition causing systems to crash during
   initialization in some situations.  This removes the affected
   code altogether.  From Dirk Brandewie.

 - ACPIPHP fix for a regression introduced during the 3.12 cycle
   causing devices to be dropped as a result of bus check notifications
   after system resume on some systems due to the way ACPIPHP interprets
   _STA return values (arguably incorrectly).  From Mika Westerberg.

 - ACPI dock driver fix for a problem causing docking to fail due to
   a check that always fails after recent ACPI core changes (found by
   code inspection).

 - ACPI container driver fix to prevent memory from being leaked in
   an error code path after device_register() failures.

 - Update of the arm_big_little cpufreq driver maintainer's e-mail
   address.

Thanks!
