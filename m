Orderly power off is supposed to take care of this. Looking at the code,
it will force a shutdown in case execution of userland command fails:

static int __orderly_poweroff(bool force)
{
        int ret;

        ret = run_cmd(poweroff_cmd);

        if (ret && force) {
                pr_warn("Failed to start orderly shutdown: forcing the issue\n");

                /*
                 * I guess this should try to kick off some daemon to sync and
                 * poweroff asap.  Or not even bother syncing if we're doing an
                 * emergency shutdown?
                 */
                emergency_sync();
                kernel_power_off();
        }
