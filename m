Hmm, the tps65217 doesn't have a USB PHY like others tps, so not sure
how could affect this patch. Did you see this issue in any board that
uses tps65217 or any am335x based board which commonly uses this pmic?

i don't think this is the case of the boards that use tps65217 as the
pins can't be muxed to GPIO mode.
