This has to depend on how the device is going to be used.  Will there
be multiple user processes, each using it independently?  In that case
a single attribute value won't work; some sort of counter will be
needed.  Will all access funnel through a single process?  Then a
single attribute value will work, and that attribute might as well be
power/control.

I'm not fully convinced that we are yet in a good position to do
anything along these lines.  A driver can generally tell when it is
being used easily enough: If there are I/O calls then it is in use.  
Of course there are exceptions, like a display screen that is in use
when the user is looking at it, not when the display is being updated.

To the extent that drivers can tell what's going on just by monitoring
their own activities, we don't need a new interface.  For anything
beyond that, it seems likely that the situation will vary considerably
from one device to another.  At this point we don't have enough
experience to specify a single approach that will work everywhere.

Especially since I haven't seen any scenarios so far that can't be
solved using the existing interfaces under power/.

For such drivers, the only question is "Does userspace want me to
suspend now?"  This question can be answered by
power/autosuspend_delay_ms or by power/control.  Why is a new flag
needed?
