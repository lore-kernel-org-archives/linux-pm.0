Yes. In ChromeOS we have a custim "inhibit" control that:

1. Tells input core to ignore all events form a given device
2. Allows driver to put device in low power mode if driver desires to do
so. The driver can do it via runtime PM or on it's own. Usually on it's
own since when using runtime PM userspace may disable it, which may not
be desirable.

I would love to have something generic instead of input-specific.

I'd call it "accelerating" runtime suspend. Userspace tells the kernel
that it intends not to use given device and kernel reacts accordingly.

I do not really want input specific support; as I mentioned before we
have something like that in ChromeOS kernels but I was hesitant bringing
it upstream as I believe it is not necessarily input device specific and
I would love to have it implemented at device core level.

Thanks.
