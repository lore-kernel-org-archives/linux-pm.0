I see. A couple of questions here:
a. A regular shutdown command on your setup takes 5 to 10 s? What is the
PHY underneath your NFS? 56K modem?
b. Or did you mean it takes 5 to 10 s because you keep calling
orderly_poweroff?

Ok. Nice. But how long does it take?

Well, why not? Because we assume that all sources of shutdown within
kernel are all gonna happen in different time? What if thermal calls and
another subsystem/driver calls it too. Does work if user space also
calls shutdown in the middle of a thermal shutdown? I think we need to
think this through a bit more..

I agree. But there it nothing that says it is not reenterable. If you
saw something in this line, can you please share?

I am happy to see that Keerthy found the problem with his setup and a
possible solution. But I have a few concerns here.

1. If regular shutdown process takes 10seconds, that is a ballpark that
thermal should never wait. orderly_poweroff() calls run_cmd() with wait
flag set. That means, if regular userland shutdown takes 10s, we are
waiting for it. Obviously this not acceptable. Specially if you setup
critical trip to be 125C. Now, if you properly size the critical trip to
fire before hotspot really reach 125C, for 10s (or the time it takes to
shutdown), then fine. But based on what was described in this thread,
his system is waiting 10s on regular shutdown, and his silicon is on
out-of-spec temperature for 10s, which is wrong.

2. The above scenario is not acceptable in a long run, specially from a
reliability perspective. If orderly_poweroff() has a possibility to
simply never return (or take too long), I would say the thermal
subsystem is using the wrong API.


If you are going to implement the above two patches, keep in mind:
i. At least within the thermal subsystem, you need to take care of all
zones that could trigger a shutdown.
ii. serializing the calls to orderly_poweroff() seams to be more
concerning than cancelling all monitoring.
