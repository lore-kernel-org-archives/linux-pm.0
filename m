Why would it be open coded? Just create library functions to parse the
node and implement the generic pwr-seq steps.

I'm not proposing open coding, but having generic library functions.
I'm not saying the mmc pwr-seq has to change from being a driver
either. Leave it as is. I'm only talking about Krzysztof's new
proposal.

Only a few because we've pushed back against defining state machines in DT.

No. I'm pretty that is not how kernel development works. Features get
merged when all are happy (or not paying attention).

>From what I recall, all attempts have worked around the problem that
the driver model has no way to either force probe or provide a
pre-probe hook on probeable buses. This then leads to the work-around
defining the DT binding.
