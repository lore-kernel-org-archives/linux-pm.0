Why is it a BUG in the trusted app, when I initiate a download and put
the phone down ?

That download might take a minute or two, but that's not an
justification for the crapplication to run unconfined and prevent
lower power states.

Sorry, that's really the worst argument I saw in this whole
discussion.=20

You're basically saying, that you have no idea what your user space
stack is doing and you do not care at all as long as your suspend
blocker scheme makes things work somehow.

Up to that point, I really tried hard to step back from my initial
"OMG, promoting crap is a nono" reaction and work with you on a
sensible technical solution to confine crap and make it aligned with
other efforts in this area.

So now, after I spent a reasonable amount of time (as you did) to
understand what your requirements are, you come up with another
restriction which is so outside of any level of sanity, that I'm at
the point of giving up and just going into NAK mode.

Can you please answer the following question:

    What is the point of having the distinction of "trusted" and
    "untrusted" when you have no way to prevent "trusted" code calling
    "into "untrusted" code ?

That's violating any sense of abstraction and layering and makes it
entirely clear that the only way you can deal with your own design
failure is a big hammer which you need to force into the kernel.

Sorry, no. I'm perfectly willing to make progress on that, as long as
we walk on a sane ground. But abusing the kernel for fixing basic
engineering problems in the user space side of affairs is completely
out of discussion.

It does not matter. Even Intel folks told you more than once, that x86
hardware is going to be fixed pretty soon. Hint: that's crucial to
their business ....

See above.
