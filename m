That file is solely intended for IDs used in multiple places, as
explained in the comment at its top.  This particular ID is only used
in the PCI core, hence it's in the PCI core's private drivers/pci/pci.h.

However the line is formatted such that it can just be moved to the
global include/linux/pci_ids.h should it be needed someplace else in
the future.

The is_thunderbolt bit signifies whether a given PCI device is part
of a Thunderbolt daisy chain.  (As explained in the comment in
include/linux/pci.h, see below.)  So it is set on all the PCI devices
that comprise a Thunderbolt controller, but also on all endpoint devices
that are attached via Thunderbolt.

Consequently this function needs to be executed for all PCI devices,
not just for a subset that could be identified by a vendor, device or
class ID.

In the DRM drivers nouveau, radeon and amdgpu I need to prevent calls
to vga_switcheroo_register_client() and vga_switcheroo_init_domain_pm_ops()
if the device in question is attached via Thunderbolt.  That's because
external GPUs can't drive the panel of a laptop or be powered down like an
on-board Optimus/PowerXpress GPU.  We've got a bug there right now that
manifests itself once someone attaches an eGPU to a dual GPU laptop.
With this patch I'll be able to just skip registration with vga_switcheroo
if is_thunderbolt is set on a GPU's pci_dev, thereby fixing the bug.


BTW do you have information on the contents/meaning of the VSEC that you
would be able/allowed to share?  What I've seen so far is that its length
is 0x1c bytes on older controllers (e.g. Light Ridge, Port Ridge) and its
contents are always the same, regardless if the controller is used in
host mode or endpoint mode:

500: 0b 00 01 00 34 12 c1 01|50 09 00 00 39 00 00 00
510: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

However on Alpine Ridge the size of the VSEC has increased significantly
to 0xd8 bytes, even though the version stayed at 1 as before:

500: 0b 00 01 60 34 12 81 0d 50 09 b0 0c b9 06 18 08
