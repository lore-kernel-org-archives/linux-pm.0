I also mentioned doing such things in usb port driver in 4/5, and I'd
like to get some feedback about which one is better.

The problem is that you have to move all platform code into drivers/usb
because usb port is not a platform device, and there is no easy way to
obtain some platform dependent info.(You can ague we can get it from
hcd driver, but someone may object it).

Another problem is that smsc95xx chip are used in more than one board,
and with different power on/off approach, such as beagle vs. panda, so
the single omap port driver has to consider board difference things, I am
wondering if it is good to do in port driver and if USB guys can agree on it.

Sp I post these patches just for making the discussion moving on.
