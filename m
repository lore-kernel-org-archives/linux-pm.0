I see.

I got another thought about this. I noticed these input drivers need 
SMBus Host Notify, maybe that explain the PM dependency? If that's the 
only dependency then we could prevent the controller suspend if there is 
a client needing host notify mechanism. IMHO that's less hack than the 
patch to rmi_smbus.c.

Keijo: care to test does this idea would fix the issue (without the 
previous patch)? I also attached the diff.

I guess you mean the Rafael's pm_runtime_get_sync() comment?
