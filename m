Hi Linus,

Please pull from the tag

 git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rafael/linux-pm.git \
 pm-4.15-rc1

with top-most commit 990a848d537e4da966907c8ccec95bc568f2911c

 Merge branches 'pm-devfreq' and 'pm-tools'

on top of commit e029b9bf1221f200319541cd6861912b89345665

 Merge branch 'pm-cpufreq-sched'

to receive power management updates for 4.15-rc1.

There are no real big ticket items here this time.

The most noticeable change is probably the relocation of the
OPP (Operating Performance Points) framework to its own directory
under drivers/ as it has grown big enough for that.  Also Viresh
is now going to maintain it and send pull requests for it to me,
so you will see this change in the git history going forward (but
still not right now).

Another noticeable set of changes is the modifications of the PM
core, the PCI subsystem and the ACPI PM domain to allow of more
integration between system-wide suspend/resume and runtime PM.
For now it's just a way to avoid resuming devices from runtime
suspend unnecessarily during system suspend (if the driver sets
a flag to indicate its readiness for that) and in the works is
an analogous mechanism to allow devices to stay suspended after
system resume.

In addition to that, we have some changes related to supporting
frequency-invariant CPU utilization metrics in the scheduler and
in the schedutil cpufreq governor on ARM and changes to add support
for device performance states to the generic power domains (genpd)
framework.

The rest is mostly fixes and cleanups of various sorts.

Specifics:

 - Relocate the OPP (Operating Performance Points) framework to its
   own directory under drivers/ and add support for power domain
   performance states to it (Viresh Kumar).

 - Modify the PM core, the PCI bus type and the ACPI PM domain to
   support power management driver flags allowing device drivers to
   specify their capabilities and preferences regarding the handling
   of devices with enabled runtime PM during system suspend/resume
   and clean up that code somewhat (Rafael Wysocki, Ulf Hansson).

 - Add frequency-invariant accounting support to the task scheduler
   on ARM and ARM64 (Dietmar Eggemann).

 - Fix PM QoS device resume latency framework to prevent "no
   restriction" requests from overriding requests with specific
   requirements and drop the confusing PM_QOS_FLAG_REMOTE_WAKEUP
   device PM QoS flag (Rafael Wysocki).

 - Drop legacy class suspend/resume operations from the PM core
   and drop legacy bus type suspend and resume callbacks from
   ARM/locomo (Rafael Wysocki).

 - Add min/max frequency support to devfreq and clean it up
   somewhat (Chanwoo Choi).

 - Rework wakeup support in the generic power domains (genpd)
   framework and update some of its users accordingly (Geert
   Uytterhoeven).

 - Convert timers in the PM core to use timer_setup() (Kees Cook).

 - Add support for exposing the SLP_S0 (Low Power S0 Idle)
   residency counter based on the LPIT ACPI table on Intel
   platforms (Srinivas Pandruvada).

 - Add per-CPU PM QoS resume latency support to the ladder cpuidle
   governor (Ramesh Thomas).

 - Fix a deadlock between the wakeup notify handler and the
   notifier removal in the ACPI core (Ville Syrj=C3=A4l=C3=A4).

 - Fix a cpufreq schedutil governor issue causing it to use
   stale cached frequency values sometimes (Viresh Kumar).

 - Fix an issue in the system suspend core support code causing
   wakeup events detection to fail in some cases (Rajat Jain).

 - Fix the generic power domains (genpd) framework to prevent
   the PM core from using the direct-complete optimization with
   it as that is guaranteed to fail (Ulf Hansson).

 - Fix a minor issue in the cpuidle core and clean it up a bit
   (Gaurav Jindal, Nicholas Piggin).

 - Fix and clean up the intel_idle and ARM cpuidle drivers (Jason
   Baron, Len Brown, Leo Yan).

 - Fix a couple of minor issues in the OPP framework and clean it
   up (Arvind Yadav, Fabio Estevam, Sudeep Holla, Tobias Jordan).

 - Fix and clean up some cpufreq drivers and fix a minor issue in
   the cpufreq statistics code (Arvind Yadav, Bhumika Goyal, Fabio
   Estevam, Gautham Shenoy, Gustavo Silva, Marek Szyprowski, Masahiro
   Yamada, Robert Jarzmik, Zumeng Chen).

 - Fix minor issues in the system suspend and hibernation core, in
   power management documentation and in the AVS (Adaptive Voltage
   Scaling) framework (Helge Deller, Himanshu Jha, Joe Perches,
   Rafael Wysocki).

 - Fix some issues in the cpupower utility and document that Shuah
   Khan is going to maintain it going forward (Prarit Bhargava,
   Shuah Khan).

Thanks!
