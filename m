Is this issue specific to the "ACPI/SMI Thunderbolt" implementations
used in non-Mac PCs or is PCI hotplug in general done through SMI/ACPI
instead of the native pciehp port driver? Wouldn't it make more sense
to only disable runtime suspend on non-Mac thunderbolt ports (or ports
using ACPI hotplug, if that is detectable).
