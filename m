I have to agree with Felipe here. I do see your point to have a name
which is applicable to AMxx, but having such generic naming is not
helping either :-( as this bandgap driver is not supposed to be
generic.

I though of "ti_bandgap.*", but still seams to be misleading..

I guess same applies to usb_phy and scm.

Again, if you have a name that fits better I won't hesitate to use it :=
