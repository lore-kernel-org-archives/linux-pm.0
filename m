The interrupt handler might be called because the interrupt is shared i.e.
the interrupt is for a different device.  In that case the host controller
might be off and the registers inaccessible.  In that case we cannot even
look at the interrupt register to determine if we were expecting the interrupt.

In the case of SDIO Card interrupt, it is delivered via the host controller,
so we have to assume the registers are accessible if we are
runtime-suspended with the SDIO IRQ enabled.

I don't mind allowing card detect interrupts while runtime suspended, but we
need a flag so that:
- runtime suspend leaves the insert/remove interrupts enabled
- irq handler knows it can access registers
- irq thread handler knows to runtime resume before doing anything else

But it seems like you need to persuade Ulf first.
