ACPI very well may be the only case needing to walk the hierarchy for that.

So unless I know you'll need it, please don't add it.

One WAKE# pin per device is reasonable enough, but WAKE# is specifically
defined as out-of-band and "orthogonal" to the PCIe hierarchy.  What you
need is a way to program WAKE# and (possibly) wakeup power on the given
platform for each device having a WAKE# pin individually.
 
The main reason why ACPI needs to walk the hierarchy is that on some systems
the firmware takes over the handling of the native PME mechanism which then is
taken care of by the AML (and the kernel is not granted control of the
relevant PCIe registers).  I don't think you'll ever see anything like that
on non-ACPI systems.

Well, that's quite questionable.

At least defining ->dev_wakeup to do device_set_wakeup_capable() doesn't
really make sense to me.

The only thing you need IMO is ->set_wakeup which also is what ACPI needs
and that enables or disables wakeup for the device.  It doesn't actually
have to track anything (other than, possibly, whether or not wakeup has
been enabled for it already).

And since the core takes care of native PMEs for you, the only thing
this needs to cover is the WAKE# pin programming AFAICS.

The setup part, in turn, in the ACPI case is done via acpi_platform_notify()
and, analogously, acpi_platform_notify_remove() does the cleanup.  You seem
to be trying to add something like it via pci_platform_pm_ops, but is it
really the most suitable place for that?

Again, ACPI does that via acpi_platform_notify()/acpi_platform_notify_remove(),
so maybe something similar?

In any case, you need a way to associate DT-provided data with PCI devices and,
ideally, that should be done at the enumeration time.

Well, that's not the way it is done in the ACPI case anyway.
