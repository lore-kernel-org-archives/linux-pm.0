Yes. With Nvidia Optimus / AMD PowerXpress hybrid graphics on non-Macs
and Thunderbolt on Macs, it could still be argued that D3cold is
facilitated by the platform, albeit with custom methods instead of _PS3.

With hybrid graphics on Macs, the discrete GPU is turned off by
a gmux controller on the LPC bus which is controlled via I/O ports.
So the ACPI platform isn't involved at all and at least then we're
in completely nonstandard territory.

The more I think about it, the more I lean towards the one-line change
at the top of this e-mail, even though you found it clumsy. It's small
and simple and fixes the problem without overengineering things.

The reasoning is that going from D3cold to D3hot before system sleep
just never makes sense, no matter if the device got there by standard
or nonstandard means. So the default target state should be D3cold if
the device is already there, and D3hot otherwise. I could perhaps try
to make this clearer by adding a comment.

Thanks,
