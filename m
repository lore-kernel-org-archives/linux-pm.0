Suspend blockers are only a flawed and indirect way to keep the vampire
from sucking.

He's getting at the fact that there are much better ways to deal with
this problem. The issue here is that we seem to be expected to swallow
whatever Google throws at us, regardless of the quality of the
solution. It seems like the best argument we have for merging is "we
couldn't think of anything better and we need it yesterday." This might be
a good enough reason for shipping, but it certainly doesn't satisfy the
requirements for merging.

It is absolutely not. If you want to keep power usage down, then
implement real resource management in the scheduler. Suspend blockers
are nothing but a clunky and ineffective means of resource allocation.
As has been pointed out in this thread, there are much better ways of
dealing with this problem.
