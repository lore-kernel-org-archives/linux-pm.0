The difference here compared to all other user interfaces, is that this
interface has the sole purpose of showing what is happening inside the
kernel. By saying that "we expose this to userspace, it must too be
stable" is saying that all kernel internals that use trace events must
never change.

The big push against tracepoints/trace-markers/trace-events in the
beginning was the fear that they will hinder kernel development because
they become interfaces for users to see what is happening inside the
kernel. When I wrote the interface, I put it in the debugfs system so
people will know that this is a debug interface and can change without
notice.

Trace-events, unlike syscalls, may change depending on how you compiled
the kernel. There's no guarantee that they will even exist on a system.

If all trace-events are now stable ABI, then I suggest we stop adding
any more events, and only add new ones to places that we do not expect
to develop the kernel on anymore.

Not sure what other solution there is. Trace points have been added way
too freely, because any maintainer could add them to their system any
way they felt like it. Now if they are frozen in stone, then the code
that they expose must also be frozen.
