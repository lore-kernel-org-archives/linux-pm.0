But what if its the _right_ thing to do? We make changes to every device
driver out there on a regular basis. Also, why won't an incremental
process work? Add the interface with a fallback for drivers that haven't
implemented it and implement it for those drivers its most urgent (like
those in use on an Android phone).

Not doing the right thing simply because its a lot of work seems like a
fine way to let the kernel rot into an unmaintainable mess.
