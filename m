No, none of the patches in this series have been merged so far.  Greg's
tree is closed for the duration of the merge window, which is expected
to open today.  Therefore, please merge whatever patches in this series
you feel comfortable with.  It would be good if you could merge at least
patch [1/8] as it would allow me to fix the issues in apple-gmux and
vga_switcheroo that I'm mentioning in the changelog in v4.12.  Also,
patch [2/8] seems uncontroversial.

Greg has acked v5 of this series and suggested that you take it due to
all the PCI changes:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/1/19/177

Andreas Noever acked and tested v2 of this series:
https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-pci/msg51274.html

Sure, I've renamed it.

Thanks,
