Had you checked the assembly? I'm talking about const for values on the stack.

I think if you put less const there compiler can keep something in the
registers instead of using direct constants or accessing stack.

I might be mistaken, so, I can't argue without evidence of either.

Again, what the difference do you see in assembly if any?

The point is, if there is no difference, I would prefer one which will be
better to read, otherwise check the assembly.

80-characters rule can be slightly bended depending on the context. Here, I
think, we might continue discussing the matter after having an evidence how
const qualifiers affect the code.
