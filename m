If I understand correctly, you are saying that all the untrusted 
applications should run with QoS(NONE).  Then they could do whatever 
they wanted without causing any interference.

And with idle-based power management (rather than forced suspend), 
there would be no issue with wakeup events getting unduly delayed.

Unless one of those events was meant for an untrusted application.  Is 
that the source of the difficulty?
