Why does this function need to do anything more than:

- Check if the child has a "power-sequence" property
- Get the "reset-gpios" GPIO
- Assert reset for specified/default time
- Deassert reset

Then continue on as normal. That seems straight-forward to me.

There is no reason you need a platform device in the mix. Perhaps trying 
to move the MMC pwr-seq code is pointless as it adds needless 
complexity.

What can be handled by is defined by presence of power-sequence 
property. There can be 1 driver for the device. That is the USB hub 
driver in this example. You should not have 2 "devices".
