Right.

Right.

I do not think anybody expects that drivers would not have to be modified to 
support this functionality; I expect drivers would have to declare themselves 
"queiscable" and therefore would assert that they will act according to 
whatever rules we set up. I only want to make sure that this new state is 
added to existing list of PM states rather than creating completely new 
facility, so that driver authors have a chance to understand PM state 
transitions that involve their driver. 

Thanks,
Dmitry
