Its not 56K modem but also i am not running on busybox!
Its a full fledged arago file system. Yes i have run a basic poweroff
and it takes about 5S. I will share the logs with timings the first
thing tomorrow.

If we keep calling orderly_poweroff it would never shutdown. Hence the
issue.

About 5-10S as i mentioned.

First and foremost there is an issue here where in we keep calling
orderly_poweroff which needs to be addressed.

Definitely we need to think a lot more but point agreed. Why is thermal
framework calling orderly_poweroff multiple times? Say even if you
manage to shut off in 2 seconds you still end up calling 4 to 8 times
depending on 500mS or 250mS delay.

2 approaches can be taken here:

1) Reduce the critical temperature to something lesser than the hardware
critical point.

Or

2) Call kernel_power_off directly as you are in a pretty critical
situation! That only takes less than a second and powers off the PMIC at
least on OMAP5/DRA7.

As mentioned above kernel_power_off?

Do you think it makes sense for all the 'n' sensors to trigger
orderly_poweroff one by one? Or we should worry about the first source
and ensure that it shuts off the system?

Is it not enough to catch the first critical alert and poweroff
