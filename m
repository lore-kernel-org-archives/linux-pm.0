We handle that too.

The way we handle it, that the pm_domain code "knows" that the device
*should* be runtime suspended by the time the pm_domain suspend_noirq
callback is called.  So it checks pm_runtime_status_suspended() and if
the device is not runtime suspended, the pm_domain will "forcibly"
runtime suspend the device (which just means, calling the driver's
->runtime_suspend(), doing the bus-level magic, and setting the runtime
PM state accordingly.)

This is arguably the same approach as the using the late callbacks that
you've already described, but it's just done in a hidden way at the bus
level.  Also, this solution predates the addtion of the late callbacks
and I believe may have even been initially proposed by you (or maybe
Rafael, I forgot.)
