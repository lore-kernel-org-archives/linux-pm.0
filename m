Early Android used early suspend, which notified various kernel
drivers that the screen was turning off so they could go into low
power states.  That meant there was no reason to close the touchscreen
fd - the kernel already knew about the screen off event.  We then got
rid of the early suspend hack and moved everything into userspace
using the power HAL and sysfs files.  Getting rid of the touchscreen
sysfs files and closing the touchscreen on screen off was on the
nice-to-have list, but hasn't made it onto anybody's todo list.
