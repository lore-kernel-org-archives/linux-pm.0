I guess there are several reasons, but the one that think stands the
best is the race condition you are referring to above. I were more or
less looking at the below commits to try to get a summary of the
history, I guess there are more. :-)

When your .suspend_late callback gets called, your device may be
either active or inactive from runtime PM point of view. Just pointing
the .suspend_late callback to the .runtime_suspend callback, simply
wont work.

That would mean we might end up in trying to inactivate an already
inactivated device, which I doubt is a good thing.:-) Some additional
code will be needed to track the "runtime state" and to act
accordingly. This is what drivers already tries to handle as of today,
though so far mostly from their .suspend callbacks I believe.

I see your point and in most cases you are right. But, I am also sure
that quite many drivers should be able to cope with only runtime PM
callbacks. I have collected a bunch of examples that I can share, if
you are interested?

Kind regards
