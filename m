Changes V6:
* split up -EPROBE_DEFER and irq allocation patch into small steps:
	* convert iio to devm allocation (by Sebsatian Reichel)
	* fix potentially wrong initialization sequence (by Grygorii Strashko)
	* add -EPROBE_DEFER

2017-05-21 12:38:24: Changes V5:
* reworked max_current removal patch (comments by Sebastian Reichel)
* resubmit missing madc connection for AC power detection
* resubmit patch for irq allocation and -EPROBE_DEFER
* rebased on 4.12-rc1

Changes V4:
* resent commit (original one did contain material not upstream)

2017-04-14 21:29:39: 2017-04-14 20:26:00: Changes V3:
* worked in comments by Sebsatian Reichel
* clarifications of some commit messages
* rebased on v4.11rc-6

It took a while (18 months) until we propose an updated patch for upstream...

2015-11-02 12:27:39: Changes V2:
* worked in comments by Nishanth Menon <nm@ti.com>
* added another patch which solves a probing/boot stall problem (irq allocation vs. -EPROBE_DEFER)

V1:
4.3-rc1 introduced a new charger driver for the twl4030. This patch set fixes some
issues.

While making twl4030 changes from 4.3 operable we have found some issues
during testing on GTA04 and OpenPandora.

H. Nikolaus Schaller (4):
  power: supply: twl4030-charger: allocate iio by devm_iio_channel_get()
    and fix error path
  power: supply: twl4030-charger: move allocation of iio channel to the
    beginning
  power: supply: twl4030-charger: move irq allocation to just before
    irqs are enabled
  power: supply: twl4030-charger: add deferred probing for phy and iio
