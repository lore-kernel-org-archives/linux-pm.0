No, I really think it is wrong. This what leads us to the situation we
are in at the moment. Every device [re]implements  its own little knobs
to do power management. Accelerometers export their (often tailored to a
specific platform) attributes in sysfs in nonstandard way. And so on,
and so forth.

Here I'd like to see these (PM) hooks done on device core level, i.e.
the knobs should be unified and live in /sys/devices/.../deviceX/power/

Thanks.
