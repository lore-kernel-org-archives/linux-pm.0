Felipe,

unfortunately, get_maintainer.pl doesn't give a hint that this and the
other affected patches should be sent to linux-omap. How am I supposed
to know ?

Note that linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org was copied on the entire series,
if that is what you mean with lakml. linux-pm@vger.kernel.org was also
copied on all patches. Additional mailing lists were only copied for
affected architectures to avoid for the patches to be tagged as spam.

If there is a list named lakml, I must have missed it, and I seem to be
unable to find a reference to it. If that is the case, my apologies,
and please provide a link to it.

Thanks,
Guenter
