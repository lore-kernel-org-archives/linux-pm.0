By static inlines I meant that the functions are moved to the appropriate
header file in include/linux/.  You don't need to worry about exporting
in that case as the code is local to each module.  For smallish functions
like these, static inlines are usually fine.  See drivers/dma/virt-dma.h
for an extreme case of static inlines (as compared to the much smaller
virt-dma.c).

Thanks,
