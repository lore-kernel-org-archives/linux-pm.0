My patchset signs and encrypts the snapshot image pages in memory. The
main logic is applied to snapshot.c

https://github.com/joeyli/linux-s4sign/commit/bae39460393ada4c0226dd07cd5e3afcef86b71f

The pros of my solution is that the signed/encrypted snapshot image can 
be stored to anywhere. Both in-kernel and userspace.

Yu's patch is encrypt the page buffer before sending to block io layer
for writing to swap. The main logic is applied to swap.c. It's against
the swap solution in-kernel.

The pros of Yu's solution is that it encrypts the compressed image data.
So, for the huge system memory case, it has better performance.

Yu's plan is using the sysfs to switch different encrypt/sign solutions.
And, we will share encrypt/sign helper and key manager in the above two
solutions.

Thanks a lot!
