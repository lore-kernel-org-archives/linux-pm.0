The UVC driver would be enabling runtime PM for the input device that
it registers.

Not sure, tbh. What I have ended up doing in v2 is descending the tree
from the UVC device and enabling runtime PM for all descendants. The
idea is that the UVC driver knows whether it should remain runtime
suspended and that its descendants should copy it.

Fair enough, I have introduced a flag that allows the creator of the
input device to decide that.

Thanks,
