Hi,

very well, maybe we should state clearly that the goal of these
patch set is to make Secure Boot and STD coexist. Anything else
is a nice side effect, but not the primary justification, right?

And we further agree that the model of Secure Boot requires the
encryption to be done in kernel space, don't we?
Furthermore IMHO the key must also be generated in trusted code,
hence in kernel space. Yu Chen, I really cannot see how
a symmetrical encryption with a known key can be secure.
