Well, that's both flattering and concerning. ;-)

Anyway, yes, we can do that earlier AFAICS.  Action handlers are not going to
run after we've called suspend_device_irqs() which happens before the final
stage of PCI devices suspend (suspend_noirq) and it doesn't matter which CPU
gets the interrupt from that point on (it is either wakeup or unwanted then).
