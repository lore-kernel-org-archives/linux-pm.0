That's why the text says "Generally".  You're free to do it a different 
way if you want.

The usage counter can be set whenever you want; it doesn't have to be 
incremented during open and decremented during close.  You could leave 
it equal to 0 permanently.  Or you could make it nonzero precisely 
during the times when you don't want the input to be muted.

Just out of curiosity, how do you decide when the input should be 
muted and unmuted?

The framework was intended to be pretty flexible.  You should think it 
over a little more before deciding against it.
