NAK. The amount of power a card (even if there are good behaving cards
as well) may utilize, in powered but idle state could be significant.
I have seen cases of constant power consumption of several mA here.

Good news! This is "almost" supported already by the mmc subsystem.

If your mmc host has set the capability flag MMC_CAP_RUNTIME_RESUME,
that means the card won't be powered up (and initialized) until the
next request.

However, for removable cards (!MMC_CAP_NONREMOVABLE), during system
resume phase, the mmc core will trigger a "rescan" of the card, to
verify it has not been removed. Thus, unfortunate for this use case,
the first request (for removable cards) will be triggered during the
system resume phase.

I suppose we should add some extra conditions/flags which makes the
mmc core to handle the above scenario. Actually I have been thinking
of putting together a patch for this, but it never pops up on the top
of my TODO list. :-)

Additionally, I wonder if this bouncing up and down from suspend to
resume, could have other negative impact for other subsystems? Is it
just a mmc subsystem problem? I am not so sure.

Kind regards
