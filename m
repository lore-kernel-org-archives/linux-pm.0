We have a binding for the "qcom,pm8941-pwrkey", but as long as we
maintain the compatibility in the input driver with this we could come
up with a new binding for the "pon" block.

Unfortunately I do agree with this.

It would make sense to describe the pon in a single DT-node and have a
pon-driver spawning off individual driver for each functionality. That
way we get a clean representation in DT and we get clean implementation
of each component...
