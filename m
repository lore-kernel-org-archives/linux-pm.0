Well this patch will probably cause some minor merge conflicts with the
pending omap patches, not a big deal though.

The omap tree is available at [1] and the currently pending patches
pile at [2].

I thought Russell is about to apply the pending omap patches to his
tree, so let's wait until we hear from him.

Assuming Russell applies the pending omap patches, things should
be pretty much in sync with the mainline tree and linux-omap tree for
the core omap support.

There will be some driver and PM patches that would fit to -mm tree
though. At least the voltage framework, and possibly the DSP code later
on, come to mind.

Regards,

Tony
