The reason why it is done this way is because that takes less code and
is easier (or at least less error-prone, because it avoids repeating
patterns in middle layers).

Note that the callbacks only may be skipped by the core if the middle
layer has set power.skip_resume for the device (or if the core is
handling it in patch [5/6], but that's one more step ahead still).

They still can, the whole thing is a total opt-in.

But to be constructive, do you have any specific examples in mind?

This has nothing to do with general driver authors and I'm not sure
what you mean here and where you are going with this.

I've already done so, see https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10007349/

IMHO it's not really useful to drag this stuff (which doesn't change
BTW) along with every iteration of the core patches.

No, it is not easier.  And it is backwards.

So the doc needs to be fixed. :-)

But I'm guessing that this just is a misunderstanding and you mean the
phrase "it may be desirable to leave some devices in runtime suspend
after [...]".  Yes, it is talking about "runtime suspend", but
actually "runtime suspend" is the only kind of "suspend" you can leave
a device in after a system transition to the working state.  It never
says that the device must have been suspended before the preceding
system transition into a sleep state started.

This is in "noirq", so failures of that are meaningless here.

This doesn't make sense, sorry.

So the middle layer doesn't have to set power.skip_resume.

Just don't set it if you don't like the default handling, but yes, you
will affect others this way.
