cfc and cf8 still work on x86.  So you can start with the old path
and then when you know mmconfig works you can upgrade.

In fact mmconfig doesn't necessary allow access to the entire pci domain.
On AMD systems currently you will get all of the subordinate busses but
the cpus themselves will not show up in the mmconfig space.

So we should have the infrastructure to only use mmconfig for some set
of busses.  If that interface is well described we can probably
bootstrap sanely, only enabling what we know exists and like wise
only reserving what we know is used.

For chipsets I know that there is quite a bit of information publicly
available.  For intel chipsets I believe those are registers they
make available in their public docs.  For things like the Nvidia
chipset the knowledge should be in the publicly available linuxbios
code base.

Hopefully that is enough of a pointer to get people going.  I might
have enough time to write the patch but I don't have enough time to
maintain it until mmconfig becomes boring.
