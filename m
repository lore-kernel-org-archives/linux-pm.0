There is no particular board I'm targeting this for however platform
data support has been tested with a board file that I created for one of
the TI devices (don't worry I won't try to upstream that one :)

these devices for the largest audience possible hence the added pdata
support as there are still archs out there that don't support DT/ACPI.

With the changes based on your suggestion to use the gpiod interface
also for pdata this patch has become almost trivial and so should be the
effort removing this support should it ever become necessary.
