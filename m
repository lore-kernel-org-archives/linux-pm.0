While the system is running and the fs is mounted, your data
is as secure as root access to your machine, right? You encrypt
a disk primarily so data cannot be recovered (and altered) while
the system is not running.

Secure Boot does not trust root fully. There is a cryptographic
chain of trust and user space is not part of it.

Please explain. You will always have to suspend the whole machine
with all tasks of all users. And STD with Secure Boot need not
imply that you encrypt your discs. You need to encrypt only
kernel memory to meet the requirements.

As STD affects the whole machine it must require root rights.
So I cannot see how you can talk about a session belonging
to a user. Please explain.

It seems to me that you can in theory encrypt the password
by a key coming from user space, so that you need to know
an additional key to resume the system, but that seems to me
above and beyond what Secure Boot requires.
