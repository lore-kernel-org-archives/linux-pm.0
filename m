Note that the style in this file is to use _two_ spaces after the 
period at the end of each sentence.

This entire sentence should be inside parentheses.

Don't remove the phrase "(for example, if the callback function has 
started a delayed suspend)".

I think you can end the sentence after "flag".  Otherwise it sounds 
like the only reason for calling rpm_suspend() is to respect drivers 
using autosuspend, which is not accurate.
