Seems ARM doesn't have endless loop implemented in machine_power_off() - so,
not too much chances for Watchdog to fire.
void machine_power_off(void)
{
	local_irq_disable();
	smp_send_stop();

	if (pm_power_off)
		pm_power_off();

	--- endless loop ?
	--- or restart ?
}
[and even if it will be there - 20-30sec is usual timeout for Watchdog and this
enough time to burn the system in case of thermal emergency poweroff :(]

That's true - original log [1] has 
Nov 30 11:19:22 [    5.942769] thermal thermal_zone3: critical temperature reached(108 C),shutting down
[...]
Nov 30 11:19:24 [    7.387900] ahci 4a140000.sata: flags: 64bit ncq sntf stag pm led clo only pmp pio slum part ccc apst 
Nov 30 11:19:24 INIT: Switching to runlevel: 0
Nov 30 11:19:24 INIT: Sending processes the TERM signal

and there are no
[  220.004522] reboot: Power down


Also, It's not the first time this part of code is discussed (thermal emergency poweroff) [2],
so the good question, as for me, is it really required and safe to use orderly_poweroff() in
case of thermal emergency poweroff ([3] as example)?

In general, this kind of use case can be simulated using SysRq on any arch
- [3.290034] Freeing unused kernel memory: 492K (c0a67000 - c0ae2000)
  INIT: version 2.88 booting
  Starting udev
^^ The issue most probably might happens when system in the process of loading modules
So, once modules loading process is started - fire Sysrq "poweroff(o)"
