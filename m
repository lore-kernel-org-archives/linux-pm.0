Good to know this.

In __device_suspend, if pm_domain is set, the suspend callback is
fetched there, no matter if there is a suspend callback defined in the
pm_domain or not. In ACPI PM domain's case, the suspend callback is
NULL, so the driver's suspend callback is used then.

I consulted Rafael whether adding a NULL check before goto Run is OK
like the following shows:

diff --git a/drivers/base/power/main.c b/drivers/base/power/main.c
index 1b41fca3d65a..506583d84ed4 100644

 		info = "power domain ";
 		callback = pm_op(&dev->pm_domain->ops, state);
-		goto Run;
+		if (callback)
+			goto Run;
 	}
 
 	if (dev->type && dev->type->pm) {

And Rafael said that would introduce regressions elsewhere, so it's a no
go.

Does this mean after the function device is suspended from PM core's
pespective, the mmc core will still send some requests to the function
device? I did see one such request, disable_width, get sent after the
function driver's suspend callback is invoked, don't know if there are
others.

>From the mmc_sdio_suspend function I can see two things are done:
1 function device driver's suspend callback is called;
2 optionally disable_width and power off the card according to some flags.

So once we fixed the -ENOSYS problem, can we have the function device
run its own suspend callback and have the mmc_sdio_suspend just did the
disable_width and power off thing?

OK, I see, I'll try to come up with a patch for this, thanks for the
suggestion!
