Actually from looking at the schematics, it looks like the charger
pins are still there but all connected to ground. So it probably has
the charger after all, it's just not connected or used.

I'm not aware or any registers for direct detection, and indirect
detection is difficult because BCI mostly disables itself when no
charger is connected and most registers read as 0 or have old values
from last charging session (which will never happen on n900).

There is IDCODE register on twl4030 itself, but it's documented as not
meaningful when accessed over i2c (when is it meaningful then??).

drivers/mfd/twl-core.c has a i2c_device_id table of various twl4030
variants, some of which have no charger. N900 has GAIA/twl5030, which
differs from twl4030 only by vaux2 regulator according to that file.
N900's old board files specify 5030, but .dts does not.
