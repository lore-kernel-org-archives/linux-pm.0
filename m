Is there any situations , like in  probe state,  pci_dev->driver
has been set. the  pci_pm_runtime_xxx() has passed
pci_dev->driver NULL check, but at this point, probe fail
occurs, and  pci_dev->driver to be set to NULL.

What will happen ? Or this situation will never happen?
I'm confuse about this.

Because it may be dangerous to call the functions in driver
to do some actions in the device  which probe failed.

Even if it will at last probe success, the driver itself must be
very strong, because may be a lot critical data structs
haven't be created or initialized, if we call driver function in
probe state may be lead a invalid access to some pointer.

So I think this logic may have some issue, am I right?

If I am right, I have a *patch to fix this issue*, but I'm not sure
it is safe enough to do PM ops in probe state.

Actually, I face a *bug report* to this issue, access the
driver function in probe state, even though it can be fixed
in driver ( Make the driver more stronger), but the root
cause is this issue.

Pray for your reply, and I really want to know.

Thanks
