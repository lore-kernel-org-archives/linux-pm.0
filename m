How do you know if the work being done while suspending is work that
is needed to suspend or work that should abort suspend? When should
the system wake up?

It does not matter how you enter suspend. Without opportunistic
suspend, once you tell the kernel that you want to suspend, you cannot
abort. If a wakeup event occurs at this point, it will probably not be
processed until the system wakes up for another wakeup event.
