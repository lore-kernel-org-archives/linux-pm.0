Well, please see below.

I'm not sure if there is a reliable way to be honest.

Also even if the FADT etc tells you something, there's no guarantee that AML
actually follows that.

In fact, whether or not acpi_device_get_power() will ever return D3cold
for a device depends on whether or not _PR3 is there.  If it's not there,
the deepest state returned will be D3hot in any case.

So I'm not sure how useful that is in the context of D3cold detection?

That would be the case without power resources or _PSC, right?

Well, I'm not sure in what way it is safer and you get one check instead of
two. :-)

It simply contains an redundant check.

That depends on what you want to do with it next.  Callers may be added in
separate patches, no problem with that.

pci_update_current_state() is called in a few places with assumptions that need
to be re-evaluated to see if they still hold after the changes.  They probably
do, but then again, these call sites need to be double checked.  If you did
that, then fine.

But I would say that (a) the next patch will add detection of the real
post-resume power state of "direct_complete" devices and it will use
pci_update_current_state() for that (to be consistent with the rest of
the code), so (b) pci_update_current_state() needs to ask ACPI about its
view on the power state of the device for this purpose.

And if you want to change that logic for PCI, it would be good to change it
in the same way for acpi_general_pm_domain which has exactly the same problem.

Thanks,
Rafael
