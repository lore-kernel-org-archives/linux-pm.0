Define and document a new driver flag, DPM_FLAG_LEAVE_SUSPENDED, to
instruct the PM core that it is desirable to leave the device in
runtime suspend after system resume (for example, the device may be
slow to resume and it may be better to avoid resuming it right away
for this reason).

Setting that flag causes the PM core to skip the ->resume_noirq,
->resume_early and ->resume callbacks for the device (like in the
direct-complete optimization case) if (1) the wakeup settings of it
are compatible with runtime PM (that is, either the device is
configured to wake up the system from sleep or it cannot generate
wakeup signals at all), and it will not be used for resuming any of
its children or consumers.
