Hi Imre,

> PCI / PM: tune down RPM suspend error message with EBUSY and EAGAIN retval

Please capitalize the first word, e.g., "Tune ..."

Maybe "Tune down non-fatal runtime suspend error messages" would be
more to the point.  Or maybe "retryable," since it sounds like that's
what's supposed to happen.

I looked briefly for the place in the runtime PM core where we handle
EBUSY and EAGAIN specially, but I didn't find it.  A pointer would be
helpful.

The version history is very useful during development but not after
merging, so I prefer it to go after the "---" marker so it doesn't get
included in the permanent changelog.

This looks fine to me in principle.

We have the device pointer, so please use dev_printk(KERN_DEBUG) and
dev_err().  If you're OK with changing the semantics so the debug
message is only emitted when dynamically enabled, you could use
dev_dbg().

I don't know what a user is supposed to do with a message like:

  pci_pm_runtime_suspend(): ata_port_runtime_suspend+0x0/0x200 returns -12

It feels a little bit ... internal.  Using dev_err() will help anchor
it to a specific device.  It's not related to a specific PC in the
function, so maybe use %pf instead of %pF to get rid of the function
offset and size.  And the message doesn't say anything about what the
return code *means*; maybe something like:

  ata_piix 0000:00:14.0: can't suspend now (ata_port_runtime_suspend returned -11)
  ata_piix 0000:00:14.0: can't suspend (ata_port_runtime_suspend returned -12)
