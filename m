Glad you found the root cause.  If you don't think you can get this
fixed quickly, before -rc2 or -rc3, I can fairly quickly add some
checks to ext4 to detect this condition, issue a warning, and then
return an error code from the ->writepages() hook.  (Which will then
promptly be ignored by the writeback code, since, hey, what are they
going to do with an error, but that's a discussion for another forum.)
Would that be helpful?

I'm still a bit concerned with the call to set the pages' PTE to be
dirty that I found in the hibernate code, but I accept the fact that
removing it doesn't solve the s390 crash.  It still seems wrong to me,
and hopefully someone from linux-pm can look at that more closely.
