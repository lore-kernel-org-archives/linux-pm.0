Hi,

Thank you for your comment. As you say, both chip set are similar.
But new driver need for support max77843. It is support different below
- Provide Battery presence information.
- Can OTG FET control.
- Bigger Fast charge current, Top Off current Threshold selection.
- Various and bigger OTG current limitation.
- Bigger primary charger termination voltage setting.
- Different maximum input current limit selection(Different step).

I respect your opinion but I think add new driver better.

Best regards,
Beomho Seo
