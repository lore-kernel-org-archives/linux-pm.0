A reverse entry is enough to hold the physical swap, just like how the
current hibernation works with a fake shadow, you don't need a PFN
just for holding that.

Right, vtable extension is fine, there is no redundant data. I just
mean you don't need to set the PFN twice (for vswap & pswap). So
simply reusing the PFN format in the vswap layer and solving
everything there should be enough.

I'd love to :), there is a lot of work going on as you can see and
people seem to have many different proposals about this so I didn't
prioritize it. I'll try as things settle down.

Right, but swap_cache_alloc_folio with orders=3D<large order> won't
attempt a large allocation if the batch check fails, so that's fine.

"Backed by zswap" means the actual swapout already happened, which is
the case where we always have to record the memcg info because the
folio is gone, seems still fit in the model.

Zswap charge could be merged with vswap I think but pswap we just
discussed that we might want to charge it differently? And actually
vswap charge is still quite different from zswap charge if you want to
make vswap infinitely large? I think we can figure out this part as we
progress; it's not a major problem at this point.
