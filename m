Seriously complicated. The compositor and/or X.org can handle most of 
that for
input devices already. For the camera, you want the application to know 
that
the device is present, but not usable, instead of making it vanish or 
rendering
it unusable. And if you wanted to implement this in the kernel, even 
with the aid
of a user-space daemon, you're still missing the most important part, 
the device
tagging.

Once you've tagged the devices which would need to be left alone when 
the lid is
closed, or the laptop is in tablet mode, see if the problem can be 
solved within
user-space alone. I'm fairly certain it wouldn't take too long to fix 
Xorg
or a state-of-the-art compositor to behave properly.

All I see right now is making it harder to write devices drivers with no 
real benefits.
