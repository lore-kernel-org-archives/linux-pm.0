Thanks for the suggestion, but we have duplicate frequencies that have 
different voltages defined for them, so the scheme opp@<freq> won't work 
because then we end up with duplicate nodes. OPPs are a defined by a 
number of parameters, not just frequency, so always naming the nodes 
opp@<freq> won't cover all scenarios.

Dave
