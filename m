Ah yeah, the linux/wm97xx.h ... for v2.

These are ids, just as devicetree ids, or PCI ids, I don't think an enum will
fit.

Ok, will do, would you care to explain if this is something specific to your mfd
tree, or is it a kernel overall recommendation ?

Ah, that's a reminder I have still more work on this patch ... Either I remove
support for wm9705 and wm9712 in the first version, or I complete it and add the
tables :
 - wm9705_reg_defaults
 - wm9712_reg_defaults

Same story as above, either I complete wm9705 and wm9712 support or I remove it.

Emacs ... I don't see your point though, seeing it not aligned in the diff chunk
doesn't mean it's not properly aligned.

You mean I should pass ddata to mfd sub-cells, right ?

That's the whole purpose of the patch serie.

This serie transforms the wm97xx drivers from a platform driver model to an ac97
model, where the ac97 devices are automatically discovered. The long explanation
is in patch 0/9, on how it started and what is the global purpose.

The short story is : switch to the new AC97 bus driver model.

As for the "sound specific part", it's because AC97 bus is mainly used in sound
oriented drivers, but still the codec IPs provide more than just sound, as the
Wolfson codecs for instance.

Nope, it's not sound adherence you're seeing here, it's ac97 bus and driver
model adherence you're seeing. Would the bus be in drivers/ac97 instead of
sound/ac97, the code would remain the same, would be bus be i2c you would see
the same kind of calls but with i2c_xxx and not ac97_xxx.

The wm97xx needs an ac97 bus to interact with the hardware, to provide sound,
gpio, adc, etc ... functions. That's what is expressed here, and the fact that
this ac97 access has to shared amongst the mfd sub-cells, and that these cells
require :
 - wm97xx->ac97 : this one is for drivers/input/touchscreen/wm97xx-core.c

So the requirement in this case is not for ac97/sound but input/touchscreen.

I could, but I don't need to, do I ?
Moreover, if a mfd sub-cell doesn't use regmap for example, I won't include a
useless define.

Thanks for the review, Lee. This will iterate, I'll split out mfd patch(es) to
follow up the review with you and Mark to lessen the burden on your mailbox.

Cheers.
