Well you're right about that. But the problem needs to be solved at some
point. There is no good technical reason for this violation to occur
other than, "it's been this way for a while now, so let's keep it".
Essentially it's blocking the per-user imbalance checks that I'd like to
merge.

Or we could accept lots of noisy warns for the CONFIG_PM=n case.
