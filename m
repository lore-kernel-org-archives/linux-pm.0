Mostly, yes. With the current suspend blocker implementation, if you
only start blocking suspend from a user-space thread, or a freezable
kernel thread, then your suspend hook will never be called while you
block suspend unless you use forced suspend. If you for instance start
blocking suspend in response to an interrupt on the other hand, there
is no guarantee that drivers you depend on have not already been
suspended or that they will not suspend after you block suspend, so
you may have to implement a suspend hook to manually abort suspend
even when using suspend blockers. You can add a check if your suspend
blocker is active within your critical section in your suspend hook.
Our alarm driver does this.

Yes, but you can support both forced suspend and opportunistic suspend
in the same driver. Supporting both is harder if the suspend blocker
api is not in the mainline kernel.
