But isn't that okay?  When the system starts up, the PM core doesn't 
know the actual state of any device.  It just marks each device as 
RPM_SUSPENDED and disabled as it is registered.  It's the job of 
subsystems and drivers to make sure the stored state agrees with the 
actual physical state.

So why shouldn't pm_runtime_reinit() leave the structure the same as it 
would be if the device had just been registered?

Why doesn't the same problem arise the first time the device is probed?  
Or to put it another, why should a re-probe be any different from the 
initial probe?

Is this really the right way to fix the problem?
