You mean the comment in pm.h I suppose?  Yes, it isn't precise enough.

The proper documentation in devices.rst is less ambiguous, though. :-)

That requires a bit of explanation, sorry for being overly concise.

The core calls ->resume_noirq from the middle layer regardless of
whether or not the device will be left suspended, so the
->resume_noirq cannot do arbitrary things to it.  Setting
may_skip_resume by the middle layer tells the core that the middle
layer is ready for that and is going to cooperate.  If may_skip_resume
had been set by default, that piece of information would have been
missing.

Thanks,
Rafael
