OK, sorry, I confused things.  I have no objections to this part, then, let's
focus on the _idle case.

Right.  Which they can't do now, can they?

Why do you think we should allow them to do that?

Well, not really, as far as I understand it.  The semantics of spin_lock_irq()
is "turn interrupts off to prevent interrupt handlers running on _this_ CPU
from racing with us and acquire the lock to prevent _other_ CPUs from racing
with us".  If you build the code for non-SMP it becomes the first part only.
So IMO the "turn interrupts on/off" thing is a part of the full synchronization
mechanism in this case.

Anyway, though, if the only reason of doing this is to allow interrupt handlers
to call pm_runtime_put_sync(), then I rather wouldn't do it at all.

Thanks,
Rafael
