I messed up one thing here, sorry about that.

Commit 5c493df25a0d ("Merge branch 'pci/host-generic' of
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/helgaas/pci into
acpi-resources") was supposed to be a merge, but I did something
wrong (I know what even) and it ended up as a non-merge one.
And then I didn't notice that it went wrong which was another
failure.

So this commit will conflict with d2be00c0fb5a ("of/pci: Free resources on
failure in of_pci_get_host_bridge_resources()") from the PCI tree, but
5c493df25a0d is how the final code should look like (the kfree(bus_range);
line needs to go away in particular).

Please let me know if you want me to fix this up (although that would involve
rebasing).

Rafael
