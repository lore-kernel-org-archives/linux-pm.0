Seems at least I was a bit confused. In the PCIe case the WAKE# is
owned by the PCIe slot, not the child PCIe device. So you're right,
there should be no need for the child PCIe device drivers to
implement runtime PM.

I was thinking the wakeirq case with WLAN on SDIO bus. Some WLAN
devices can have a hardwired OOB wakeirq wired to a GPIO controller.
In that case the wakeirq is owned by the child device driver
(WLAN controller) and not by the SDIO slot. I was earlier
thinking this is the same as the "Figure 5-4" case 1, but it's
not.

So in the PCIe WAKE# case for device tree, we must have the
wakeirq property for the PCIe slot for the struct device managing
that slot, and not for the child device driver. I think it's
already this way in the most recent set of patches, I need to
look again.

OK. So if "Figure 5-4" case 2 is already handled then and we need
to just deal with "Figure 5-4" case 1 :)

That can be used to tell us which device has wakeirq enabled for
wake-up events, but only for resume not runtiem PM. We still have the
shared IRQ problem to deal with. And the PCIe subsystem still needs
to go through the child devices.

Yes my test cases have it working for runtime PM and for waking
up system from suspend.

OK.

Seems like it should fix the race, I'll do some testing next week.
