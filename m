That's the best guess what happens on non-Macs.

Bjorn, do you want me to update the comment to open up what SMI means
and maybe add better explanation?

Indeed that seems to be the most reliable way.

In addition it may be possible to relax this a bit more like:

 - For ACPI hotplug bridges we disable runtime PM like we are doing
   currently.

 - For native PCIe ports supporting hotplug, enable runtime PM and call
   pci_d3cold_disable() in pcie_portdrv_probe() which allows the port to
   go into D3hot.

But I think it may be better to do that separately after v4.8-rc1 is
released :)
