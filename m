I did post some patches to support handling of clocks associated with
gdscs [1], but it got dropped at that point since there wasn't a
real user, besides there were some open issues wrt the handling of
!CONFIG_PM cases etc.
I will revive and repost those patches again now based on the
discussions last time around.
