Hi

Commit 03dbaa04a2e5 ("mmc: slot-gpio: Add support to enable irq wake on
cd_irq") enabled wakeup irrespective of the host controller's PM flags.
However, users also want to control it from sysfs power/wakeup attribute.
That means the driver needs to check the PM flags before enabling it in the
suspend callback.  Patch 4 adds support for that in sdhci-pci, which is the
only driver presently using the MMC_CAP_CD_WAKE flag.  Patches 1 - 1 tidy
up aspects of sdhci and sdhci-pci wakeup handling, and patch 3 adds a
helper function to make it easy for drivers.

There are 2 contentious aspects to this patch set:

1) An existing problem with the SDIO API which does not let the host
controller driver know that the SDIO function driver has requested SDIO
card interrupt wakeup until the suspend callback - which results in the
host controller driver having to enable or disable wakeup in the suspend
callback.  Fixing the SDIO API is a separate issue IMHO.

2) In order to use the sysfs power/wakeup attribute, the driver must set the
device as wake capable even when it is really a GPIO that wakes the system.


Changes in V2:

      mmc: sdhci-pci: Stop calling sdhci_enable_irq_wakeups()
      mmc: sdhci-pci: Use device wakeup capability to determine MMC_PM_WAKE_SDIO_IRQ capability
      mmc: sdhci: Stop exporting sdhci_enable_irq_wakeups()
      mmc: sdhci: Handle failure of enable_irq_wake()
      mmc: sdhci: Rework sdhci_enable_irq_wakeups()
	Dropped because they have been appled already
      mmc: slot-gpio: Add a function to enable/disable card detect IRQ wakeup
	Re-based
