Where do you get these figures from?

A GTA04 board discharges usually between 50 and 400 mA (depending on ac=
tivities)
and if you turn on WiFi, it will be up to 600 mA. If you use 3G it can =
draw even more
during operation.

Total current going in is 500-800 mA (depending on USB negotiations) an=
d this is
split into system operation and charging current. So 1.4A charging curr=
ent is not
possible. Rather 200-500 mA.

So it might be that the battery is discharged although the system is co=
nnected
to a charger.

The whole system is heating up a little, so that you never have -10C fo=
r the
battery.

I think you are trying to solve situations that don=92t exist in practi=
ce.

And AFAIK, the GTA04 board is the only user of this driver in case the =
battery
has no built-in fuel gauge. So why improve it beyond what the GTA04 use=
rs need?

I repeat myself: this driver is not built for highest precision because=
 there are
better methods (fuel gauge chip). These might not be available so this =
fall-back
driver has been built.

It is definitively better than no driver and worse than the optimum.

Please explain what you calculate here. Especially what =93Badness=94 i=
