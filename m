Well, if disable_depth > 0, ACTIVE isn't really well defined.  As I said,
though, I think it makes sense for pm_runtime_get_sync() to return 0 when
disable_depth > 0, because the grabbing of a reference is successful anyway and
the caller may assume that the device is accessible in that case.

In the meantime I rethought the __pm_runtime_disable() part of my previous
patch and I now think it's not necessary to complicate it any more.  Of course,
we need not check if runtime resume is pending in __device_suspend(), because
we've done it already in dpm_prepare(), but the barrier part should better be
done in there too.

Updated patch is appended.

Thanks,
Rafael
