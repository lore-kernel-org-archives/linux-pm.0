If the swap partition is too large, and there's low usage
of memory, then it might a little time costly to encrypt
the whole partition. You are right, people has choice to
choose which mode they like.

Good point, we once tried to generate key in kernel, but people
suggest to generate key in userspace and provide it to the
kernel, which is what ecryptfs do currently, so it seems this
should also be safe for encryption in kernel.

Thus Chun-Yi's signature can use EFI key and both the key from
user space.
