I somewhat understand your point.

Although, having the option to use a driver (which requires a device)
has turned out to be quite convenient from many aspects - at least in
the mmc case.

Certainly one can do without it, but in the end using a driver avoids
open coding.

Complexity?

The problem we are tying to solve, is to make the various platform/SoC
specific power sequences to be able to live in generic drivers.

One could decide to encode the sequences inside the driver code
itself, but it will soon turn into a mess and more importantly, lots
of open coding as to support different platforms/SoCs. To most kernel
hackers I don't think this is an option to consider.

The MMC pwr-seq code/drivers tries to address these issues - in a
somewhat generic way.
Initially we have decided to start with only a few flavours of
supported sequences and so far these have been sufficient.

Finally, I am indeed concerned that it so hard to agree on a solution
to deal with generic power sequences. There have been many attempts
throughout the last ~4-5 years, but peoples strong opinions about
different approaches mad them all fail. Isn't it time to finally just
pick a solution and stick with it, even if it doesn't meet all peoples
expectations?
