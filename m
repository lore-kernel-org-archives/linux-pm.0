My first thought is that if there is a separate attribute, then it only actually
makes sense for devices that generate input events, while the "off" thing may
be generally useful in principle (eg. it may indicate to disable PME for the
device to the PCI layer etc).

OTOH, the additional "inhibit" attribute may only be exposed if the corresponding
callback is present, so I'm not really sure.

Question is, though, what's the use case for turning off I/O when we don't
go into runtime suspend.  After all, runtime suspend need not mean putting
the device into any kind of low-power state and the "off" thing may very
well be defined to mean that all input is discarded if the device is
runtime-suspended and the device is not configured to do remote wakeup
then.

Thanks,
Rafael
