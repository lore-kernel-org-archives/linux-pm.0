That's the point to be discussed; does the runtime status really need to
reflect the hardware state *during* suspend?

As you've noticed, not all subsystems enforce that, even if omap seems
to have been expecting it.

And as I mentioned in the commit message, at least the point about
wanting to have late pm_runtime_get_sync() fail during suspend appears
to be moot.

I believe you're mistaken here; _od_suspend_noirq() will continue to
power-off *and* set OMAP_DEVICE_SUSPENDED, so that device is again
powered during resume_noirq also after this patch has been applied.

Specifically, note that the return value of pm_runtime_set_suspended()
was never checked, so the only difference here would be that the error
message is suppressed.

Again, the return value of pm_runtime_set_suspended() was never checked
so the only thing commit a8636c89648a ("PM / Runtime: Don't allow to
suspend a device with an active child") did was to trigger those error
messages and leave the runtime PM state at RPM_ACTIVE. The latter does
not seems to have any other side effects, and specifically, the device
would still be powered off.

What code are you running above? The OMAP PM code should not be failing
due to that error message at least (as mentioned twice above).

I have musb suspend working on BBB with the patch I posted yesterday
which keeps the controller at RPM_ACTIVE during suspend:
