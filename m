The OMAP people are working on exactly the same problem and are doing 
their best to solve it using the runtime PM framework.  There have been 
a couple of threads about it on the linux-pm mailing list:

https://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/linux-pm/2010-September/028689.html
https://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/linux-pm/2010-September/028868.html

The question is not so much how the driver should be told to power-down
a device (the PM framework takes care of all that); it's how to
recognize when those "certain circumstances" occur.  Can this be done
by the kernel in a reasonably platform-independent way?  Or does the
kernel have to be told by userspace?  The PM framework supports both 
kinds of mechanism.
