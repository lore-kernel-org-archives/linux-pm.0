It papered over a shutdown failure.  Calling it a "fix" is an overstatement IMO.

Exactly.

OK

Well, commit 52cdbdd49853 introduced a regression by itself, but that
regression has only been reported recently.

I don't really want to go into a discussion on which of the two
regressions is more painful, but then IMO going back to the state from
before commit 52cdbdd49853 is fair enough.  Hence the patch.

Again, it hid the reboot problem by changing the core in a way that
led to a shutdown regression elsewhere.

Also it looks like the platform(s) having that reboot issue do(es)n't
really do system-wide suspend/resume, because that "fix" obviously
doesn't help there.
