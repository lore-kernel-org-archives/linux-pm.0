Yes, it would.

If there's an ACPI object corresponding to the device and it allows the
device to be configured for wakeup, then device_can_wakeup() will be true
for the device's struct device object (not the ACPI one).

Yes, it does, because we don't even try to handle the ACPI case.  One reason
is that on some systems keyboard wakeup is handled entirely by the BIOS behind
our back.

Have you considered marking all of the devices in the chain as "wakeup
capable" in that case?  Then, one would have to enable wakeup for all of
them for things to work, in analogy with the USB case (a USB mouse or
keyboard may be a wakeup-capable device, but you also need to enable the
controller it's attached to to wake up).

Thanks,
Rafael
