Let me comment on the code, instead of here...

I am afraid changing pm_runtime_force* to only call driver callbacks
may become fragile. Let me elaborate.

The reason why pm_runtime_force_* needs to respects the hierarchy of
the RPM callbacks, is because otherwise it can't safely update the
runtime PM status of the device. And updating the runtime PM status of
the device is required to manage the optimized behavior during system
resume (avoiding to unnecessary resume devices).

Besides the AMBA case, I also realized that we are dealing with PM
clocks in the genpd case. For this, genpd relies on the that runtime
PM status of the device properly reflects the state of the HW, during
system-wide PM.

In other words, if the driver would change the runtime PM status of
the device, without respecting the hierarchy of the runtime PM
callbacks, it would lead to that genpd starts taking wrong decisions
while managing the PM clocks during system-wide PM. So in case you
intend to change pm_runtime_force_* this needs to be addressed too.

Absolutely agree about the different wake-up settings. However, these
issues can be addressed also when using pm_runtime_force_*, at least
in general, but then not for PCI.

Regarding hibernation, honestly that's not really my area of
expertise. Although, I assume the middle-layer and driver can treat
that as a separate case, so if it's not suitable to use
pm_runtime_force* for that case, then they shouldn't do it.

A device's parent becomes informed when changing the runtime PM status
of the device via pm_runtime_force_suspend|resume(), as those calls
pm_runtime_set_suspended|active(). In case that isn't that sufficient,
what else is needed? Perhaps you can point me to an example so I can
understand better?

For a PCI consumer device those will of course have to play by the rules of PCI.

That's the point. We know pm_runtime_force_* works nicely for the
trivial middle-layer cases. For the more complex cases, we need
something additional/different.

Indeed it is! I am definitely open to improve the situation for ACPI and PCI.

Seems like I may have given the wrong impression about that.

Alright, let me re-phrase my take on this.

Because you stated that you plan to remove pm_runtime_force_*
eventually, then I think you need to put up some valid reasons of why
(I consider that done), but more importantly, you need to offer an
alternative solution that can replace it. Else such that statement can
easily become wrong interpreted. My point is, the "driver PM flags" do
*not* offers a full alternative solution, it may do in the future or
it may not.

So, to conclude from my side, I don't have any major objections to
going forward with the "driver PM flags", especially with the goal of
improving the situation for PCI and ACPI. Down the road, we can then
*try* to make it replace pm_runtime_force_* and the "direct_complete
path".

Hopefully that makes it more clear.
