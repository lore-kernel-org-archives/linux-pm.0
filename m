If the charger does not exceed 4.2V, I'd not call it overcharge. (Yes, some clever
chargers actually let the battery drop below 4.2V when charge is done, but...)

If the charger _does_ exceed 4.2V, then the battery will explode. Don't do that. Don't
offer that to the user.

On a related note... I've just killed USB charger by overloading it. They are not protected.

I believe your automatically-pull-max-power really should stick to the well-known charging
currents (.5A, 1A, 1.7A), at the very minimum.
