Thanks! It then confirms the second option I proposed.

This isn't an error, it's just a hickup in the synchronization of the
runtime PM status.

Very similar what happens at the first probe, when the driver core has
initialized the runtime PM status to RPM_SUSPENDED at the device
registration.

To me, it's the responsible of the PM domain to *help* with the
synchronization, not prevent it as it currently does.

It's good know this works, although do you intend to fix this sequence
for all omap drivers/devices that's part of the hwmod PM domain?

I haven't checked the number of drivers this would affect, but I
imagine there could be quite many with similar behaviour and thus may
suffer from the same issue.

Of course the regression is only noticed for those returning
-EPROBE_DEFER, which might not be that many, but it seems fragile to
rely on this when going forward. All related drivers then needs to be
fixed.

Could you please test my version 2 of the patch I attached earlier. I
still believe it's the best way to solve the regression, if it works
of course. :-)

Kind regards
