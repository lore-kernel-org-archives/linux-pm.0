Okay, here's the story in a nutshell.  Allowing a subsystem's or
driver's runtime-PM callbacks to run with interrupts disabled faces two
obstacles:

   (1): We don't want two different CPUs to run callbacks for the
	same device at the same time.  So if a callback is already
	running on one CPU (i.e., if the device's runtime status is
	either SUSPENDING or RESUMING) then another CPU can't be
	allowed to invoke a callback.

	Thus, you can't do a synchronous pm_runtime_resume_irq()
	if the device is in the middle of a suspend or resume
	operation.  We're left with two choices: Fail the synchronous
	call and force the driver to defer matters to a workqueue
	(possibly masking an IRQ line in the meantime), or busy-wait
	until the concurrent operation finishes.

	If the PM core simply avoids releasing dev->power.lock before
	invoking the runtime_suspend or runtime_resume callback, the
	end result is almost the same as with busy-waiting.

   (2): In general we can't resume a device if its parent is suspended.
	If the parent's runtime_resume routine needs to run with
	interrupts enabled then there's no way to resume the device
	while keeping interrupts disabled.

	Possible solutions involve, again, deferring matters to a
	workqueue, or else simply not allowing the situation to arise
	in the first place (forbid a device to have interrupt-disabled 
	callbacks unless its parent does too or the parent doesn't use 
	runtime PM at all).

In general I'm against the solutions that require a workqueue.  Raphael 
appears to favor workqueues for (1) and be against them for (2).
