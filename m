Sure, but the "mask in ISR, handle in ->runtime_resume()" proposal
would keeping them masked while we actually could be handling them.

Even in our current GPIO code, we have a tiny (but bounded) window where
we might miss an edge-triggered GPIO interrupt while we're still
detecting the previous one.  However, this is a very small window in an
interrupts-disabled chained handler.

Right.

The interrupt to be masked would be the main GPIO bank IRQ (for the
chained handler) and it would be masked at the IRQ controller, which
is not (yet) suspended.

Right. Because in order to determine the exact interrupt source, you
have to access the GPIO controller registers and figure out which GPIO
in the GPIO bank was the source.  And then, the only way to turn off the
source is to know which device is connected to that IRQ, and disable it
via the driver for that device (e.g. network driver using a GPIO IRQ.)

IOW, When the bank IRQ fires, all we know is that (at least) one of the 32
GPIOs in the GPIO bank has an interrupt pending.  In order to determine
which one it was, we have to read GPIO controller registers, but we
can't do that until ->runtime_resume().  In order for the bank IRQ not
to continually re-fire, it would have to be kept masked until
the ISR is triggered from ->runtime_resume().

> That's different from what you wrote above.

Right, I should have said the GPIO bank IRQ needs to be masked instead
of all GPIOs in the bank need to be masked.

Yes, that's why it's not really a concern.

Yes.

In the general case, I agree.

Yes, that would definitely solve the problem, and is basically the
hack/workaround I'm using locally:

  pm_runtime_get_noresume()
  dev->pm->runtime_resume()
  /* handle IRQ */
  pm_runtime_put();

because I know this on-chip device is 1) already suspended, 2) has no
runtime PM capable parents and 3) not runtime_resume'd elsewhere.
