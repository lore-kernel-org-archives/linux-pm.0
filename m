That's fine.  We can use enums to simply group items of a similar
type.  Representing these as enums would only serve to benefit code
cleanliness.  What makes you think they won't fit?

It's personal preference.  But these aren't necessarily private, so
priv doesn't really make a great deal of sense.  These types of saved
pointers are better described as device data (ddata).

Please don't add redundant code.  I suggest you remove it for this
submission.

Remove it please.

That is true.  So the two "scruct"s are line up in the source file,
right?

Correct.

I'd like to get Mark Brown's opinion on this.
