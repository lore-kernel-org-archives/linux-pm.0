Because, as I have repeated several times during this discussion,
the user can turn off runtime PM at any time by writing "on" to
/sys/.../power/control.  In addition, as Pavel pointed out, runtime PM
might not even be configured.

Or in the way I proposed.

You could simplify runtime PM by not configuring system sleep.  Then
none of these issues would matter.  :-)

But if you want to allow a system to have both runtime PM and system 
PM, some complexity is unavoidable.

Then this is a perfect point for you to explain more clearly in the 
documentation.  If people are confused by the PM core's behavior, the 
right thing to do is explain the behavior -- not change it.

(In fact, the interaction between runtime suspend and system suspend is 
sufficiently complicated that no matter what the PM core does, it will 
end up confusing some people.)

I don't think so.  Go back and find some other features that were added 
to the kernel 1.5 years ago, and see how many places _they_ are used.

Okay, I'll take a look at these drivers.

Sorry, I omitted a word.  I meant that if .suspend takes care of
everything (prevents new I/O requests from being serviced, finishes all
ongoing I/O requests, and puts the device into a low-power state), then
.suspend_late won't need to do any work at all.

You must be joking.  There are hundreds of drivers that don't implement
.suspend_late.  Why list just these ones?  (In fact, almost no drivers
_do_ implement it.)

Drivers don't necessarily have to call pm_runtime_disable.  They can
have other ways of insuring that no runtime resumes occur at the wrong
time.  For example, it is guaranteed that all user processes will be 
frozen during a system suspend, so no runtime-resume requests can come 
from userspace.

Not necessarily; see above.

Also, the documentation does explain that drivers should call 
pm_runtime_disable from their .resume callback, as part of adjusting 
the runtime PM status to match the device's actual state.

No, it's not dependent on the situation.  Runtime suspend is always 
supposed to enable wakeup, if the hardware supports it.  This is 
documented as well.

Here's an example.  Suppose a device is in runtime suspend, with wakeup 
enabled.  Now the whole computer goes into system suspend, and the 
device is _not_ supposed to be enabled for wakeup during system 
suspend.  The driver _should_ power-up the device, disable wakeup, and 
then power the device down again.  (Or something like that.)

But if the driver uses its runtime_suspend method for system suspend, 
then it will merely see that the device is already in low power, so it 
will return without doing anything.  As a result, the device will have 
wakeup enabled even though it shouldn't.
