Yeah, I had noticed the development stuff was more up to date - it'll be
good once it gets out of QA and into general use since system
integrators do seem to pick up your new releases fairly quickly.

Having greatly cut down the number of out of tree drivers I'm carrying I
can only say that it's great when it happens :)

Probably best to do that, this thread is already quite big enough
without going off on a tangent.  FWIW we can usually be found in
#alsa-soc on freenode as well as on the lists.  A couple of pointers
which might help your research, though:

This usually doesn't go through ALSA at all (the ALSA APIs can't cope
with variable bitrate data), the data currently goes via DSP specific
APIs and gets injected into the ALSA domain in much the same way as data
from the baseband.

Routing control for embedded systems is done by exposing the routing
control to userspace via ALSA controls which can be set by apps - using
a GUI to configure the routes interactively is a massive usability win
in development.  Abstraction for generic user-visible apps is intended
to be handled by a layer on top of that:

which is currently in development but I believe is expected to come to
fruition this year (Liam is driving this one).
