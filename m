on the first step angle,
Applying current approach that Roger has taken:
Benoit's tree:
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bcousson/linux-omap-dt.git
for_3.10/dts  d114294 ARM: dts: AM33XX: Corrects typo in interrupt field in SPI node
+:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/2312211/
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/2335671/
And the diff below[1] as replacement for this patch - does indeed work on
PandaBoard. Now the question is which direction should I take - will
wait on decision in https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/4/5/173 thread.
I have similar issues: clock alias is a mess of a code to cleanup and keep alive
for mpu dplls - I have posted on this mail thread various variants of trying to
do this - there is no simple solution.

If we cannot go any further, we are essentially stalled on moving
cpufreq (OPP entries along with it, regulators, voltage ....) to device
tree.
