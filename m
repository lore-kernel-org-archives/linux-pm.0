I agree that the orignal patch was stupid in relying on the MCFG table repo=
rted
in ACPI, however, like you said, without the actual knowledge of the MCFG
region being pulled out of the hardware even the e820 check is not valid. I=
t is
close, but not entirely correct. For instance, if the MCFG region is being
reported in ACPI land as 256 buses and the e820 has a reservation at the
MCFG base address of 18MB that does not necessarily mean the MCFG region al=
lows
for PCI config access on 18 buses. It could be that it only allows 16 buses=
 w/
another piece of hardware on that last 2MB.

So what is the proper scenario? One needs to know the actual upper limit of
MCFG region. Otherwise when detecting unreachable devices one could be poki=
ng
something else in the process of trying to discover these unreachable devic=
es.
I am open to ideas and am willing to rework some of the code, but I do like=
 the
idea of having the region being reported in the resource table.
