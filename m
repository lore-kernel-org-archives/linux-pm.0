Maybe Rafael wanted to avoid changing a core routine too close to the 
start of an upcoming merge window.  At any rate, IMO it should be 
changed and now seems like a good time to try it.

Currently, retval gets set to 0 before the callback is invoked.  If 
there is no callback routine then retval will remain 0.  I agree we 
want to treat this case the same as if the callback had returned 0.

If the use_autosuspend flag isn't set then the last_busy flag isn't 
used for anything, so updating it won't hurt.
