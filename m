A step back, please.

I have no idea why those need to be PM callbacks.

What you need really seems to be a way to tell a driver "ignore input from this
device from now on as it is most likely bogus".  A natural reaction of the
driver to that might be to stop processing input from the device and then
runtime suspend it (and prevent it from generating remote wakeup as that may
be bogus as well), but I don't see why the PM core needs to be involved in
that at all.
