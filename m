I think what Rafael has in mind is that the PM core will call the amba
bus's ->suspend callback, and that routine will then be able to call
the amba driver's runtime_suspend routine directly, if it wants to --
as opposed to going through pm_runtime_force_suspend.

However, it's not clear whether this fully answers your concerns.

Presumably.

The problem is how to handle things which need to be treated
differently for runtime PM vs. system suspend vs. hibernation.  If
everything filters through a runtime_suspend routine, that doesn't
leave any scope for handling the different kinds of PM transitions
differently.  Instead, we can make the middle layer (i.e., the bus-type
callbacks) take care of the varying tasks, and they can directly invoke
a driver's runtime-PM callbacks to handle all the common activities.  
If that's how the middle layer wants to do it.

PM flags won't directly be able to cover things like disabling clocks.  
But they could be useful for indicating explicitly whether the code to
take care of those things needs to reside at the driver layer or at the
bus layer.
