Ah, interesting, so they work together on arm64? (i.e. you've actually
tested a boot loader that provides the seed for kASLR to operate?)

No, this patch was just flipping the default from hibernate to kASLR
if "kaslr" wasn't on the command line.

That was the goal, yes. A better approach would be to have hibernate
on x86 work with kASLR, but I likely won't have time to learn the
details on hibernation and debug it for a while.

Maybe RANDOMIZE_BASE_DEFAULT (default to y) and if x86 && hibernation,
select =n. and use that for selecting it?
