I am dropping this patch in v6 of my Thunderbolt runpm series.

The "Light Ridge" Thunderbolt controller in my machine claims to support
PME, but its WAKE# pin is not connected.  (It's pulled up to 3.3V.)
I also have an external Thunderbolt chassis with the same controller,
and the controller likewise claims to support PME, but its WAKE# pin is
not connected to the PCIe root im my machine in any way.

This led me to the conclusion that PME is not reliable and therefore
in a Thunderbolt daisy chain, which is a cascade of PCIe switches,
only the hotplug port at the farthest end of the chain may suspend to
D3hot, whereas all the ports between it and the root bridge must stay
awake for interrupts to come through.

What I failed to see, due to poor understanding of the (undocumented)
Thunderbolt technology, is that even though ports in the middle of the
chain may be in D3hot and prevent PCIe interrupts from coming through,
the network of Converged I/O switches underlying the PCI tunnels
continues to function and deliver plug events.  It is thus the NHI
driver's job to runtime resume the PCIe switch where a CIO plug event
occurred, as well as its parents, to ensure delivery of PCIe interrupts.
The CIO plug event essentially serves as a sideband signal.  So far the
thunderbolt NHI driver does not support daisy chaining, so this is not
yet an issue.  (Only for tunnels established by the EFI driver.)

Thanks,

Lukas
