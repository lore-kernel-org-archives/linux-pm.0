Are you refering to this?

# Generally the advantage is: Users do not have to
# encrypt the whole swap partition as other tools.
# After all, ideally kernel memory should be encrypted
# by the kernel itself.

Sorry, this does not really explain what security benefit it is
supposed have to against what attack scenarios.

Note that uswsusp already provides encryption. If this is supposed to
have advantages over it, please say so.

Also note that joeyli <jlee@suse.com> has patch series which encrypts
both in-kernel and uswsusp hibernation methods. His motivation is
secure boot. How does this compare to his work?
