That's where the problem is.  If there's a difference, from the driver's
point of view, between suspend and some other operation, there should be a
way to tell the driver what case it actually is dealing with.

BTW, what would you do in that case if the runtime PM of the device were
disabled by user space by writing "on" to the device's
/sys/devices/.../power/control file?
