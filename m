Hi,
This series adds operating-points-v2 tables for am335x, am437x, dra7xx,
and am57xx based platforms along with some support patches so that we
can enable more OPPs for the CPU on these platforms.

These patches rely on the ti-cpufreq series sent here [1] and provide
opp-supported-hw data for each OPP so that only the appropriate OPPs
for a specific piece of silicon get enabled.

Regards,
Dave
