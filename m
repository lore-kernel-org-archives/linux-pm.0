Hi,

ecryptfs can trust user space. It is supposed to keep data
safe while the system is inoperative. The whole point of Secure
Boot is a cryptographic system of trust that does not include
user space.

I seriously doubt we want to use trusted computing here. So the
key needs to be generated in kernel space and stored in a safe
manner. As we have a saolution doing that, can we come to ausable
synthesis?
