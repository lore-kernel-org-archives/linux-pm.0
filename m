As Rafael mentioned, there is bus/pm_domain code that comes into play
here, so I'm not sure it's always a bug.

IMO, it's not a bug for the driver to depend on runtime PM if the
bus/pm_domain is handling the details.

On OMAP, we handle all the SoC on-chip devices with a pm_domain since
the low-level PM operations that need to happen are bus-level things not
device-level things.  Therefore, drivers for these devices can rely
entirely on runtime PM, even for system suspend.  The late/early
callbacks in the pm_domain can see if the device is runtime suspended
already or not and behave accordingly.

So, this all *can* work by handling it at the bus/pm_domain level, but
as Ulf has mentioned (and I agree) it seems like a clunky workaround
because the PM core is preventing it from happening as one might expect.
