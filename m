I was referring to the scenario in particular:

Suppose that there are no constraits for dev initially.
A -> calls dev_pm_qos_add_request(dev)
B -> calls dev_pm_qos_add_request(dev)
A -> sees power.constraints_state == DEV_PM_QOS_DEVICE_PRESENT
     and calls dev_pm_qos_constraints_allocate(dev)
B -> sees power.constraints_state == DEV_PM_QOS_DEVICE_PRESENT
     and calls dev_pm_qos_constraints_allocate(dev)

As a result, the structure allocated by A is leaked.

That's fine.  You simply need to be more careful about the possible
race conditions when the constraints objects are created and destroyed.

OK

Yes, it is.
