As with so many other things, this depends entirely on how the 
subsystem and driver are designed.  If they are written to allow this 
sort of thing and handle it properly, there's no problem.

Nothing in the PM core itself cares whether the runtime PM routines are
invoked during system sleep.

Exactly.

Which prevents races -- the goal of synchronization.  If you use pm_wq 
for your asynchronous runtime PM events, you never have to worry about 
one of them occurring in the middle of a system sleep transition.

I'm not so sure about that.  For example, how would you prevent an 
async resume from interfering with a system suspend?

Thank you for pointing this out.  I had forgotten about this; it
implies that temporarily disabling runtime PM during system resume is
no longer safe!

Maybe we should put the get_noresume and put_sync calls back into the
PM core, but only during the system resume stages.
