That turned out to be more challenging than I had thought initially.

The last version I sent was almost OK, but it had some issues (like it could
walk the PCI hierarchy before resuming any PCI devices during system resume),
so a new version follows.  I did my best to avoid introducing any new problems
with it, but I obviously might overlook something.

It works for me and doesn't seem to break anything as far as I can say.

[1/3] Make PM workqueue available for CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME unset.
[2/3] Rework the handling of ACPI device wakeup notifications.
[3/3] Enable wakeup GPEs while setting up devices for wakeup during system
      suspend too.

Thanks!
