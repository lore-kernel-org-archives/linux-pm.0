Hi Tony,

I'm using custom am33xx board where mpu voltage can be changed through
gpio regulator on 4.1 (latest stable) kernel. I defined gpio-regulator
node and also operating-points to DT. Gpio regulator seems to be
working fine but during probing cpufreq-dt I get error:
failed to init cpufreq table: -61

I did small investigation and seem that dev_pm_opp_init_cpufreq_table
fails at first condition dev_pm_opp_get_opp_count <= 0 and this is
because opp_list is empty. So it seems that any opp for am33xx aren't
defined if I'm getting it right. I did look to mach-omap2/opp3xxx_data
but there is nothing am33xx specific. It is known problem or exist
some patches around to fix that? Many thanks.

BR,

marek
