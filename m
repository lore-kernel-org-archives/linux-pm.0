I don't really *like* the portdrv infrastructure, even though we're
sort of stuck with it now.  It seems like all it really does is allow
multiple sub-drivers to attach to a single device and share interrupts
between them.  And we get some extra devices in sysfs that don't fit
the regular PCI model.  We used to support loadable sub-drivers
(pciehp, aer, etc.), but we decided that didn't really make sense
(though I notice you do support thunderbolt as a module).

I think we would be better off if the PCIe services (hotplug, AER,
etc.) were directly integrated into the PCI core without the portdrv
abstraction in the middle.  But anyway, we do have portdrv, and the
only question here is whether extending it for Thunderbolt is the
right thing.

So the question for Thunderbolt is what benefit you get from being a
portdrv sub-driver.  It seems like basically a way for you to hook on
to PCI bridges that happen to be Thunderbolt controllers.  I don't
think you really use any portdrv services (other than forwarding the
PM ops down to you, which a regular PCI device driver would get for
free).

upstream.c does a lot of ACPI stuff; I can't tell whether it has more
affinity with ACPI or with PCI.  I don't see any PNP IDs though, so I
guess you just look for the magic method names in the ACPI device
associated with some PCI device.  That seems a little bit "back-door"
to me; from an ASL point of view, I would think you'd want to start
from a _HID and interpret the device based on that.
