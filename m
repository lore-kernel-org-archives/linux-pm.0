IMO, it shouldn't be associated with ehci-omap controller driver
because the LAN95xx is a external USB device and should be
nothing to do with ehci, but it is reasonable to be associated with
the hub port because it takes a out of band power control method.

Alos, the same ehci-omap driver and same LAN95xx chip is used in
beagle board and panda board with different power control
approach, does port driver can distinguish these two cases?
Port device is a general device(not platform device), how does
port driver get platform/board dependent info?

Not only regulators involved, clock or other things might be involved too.
Also the same power domain might be shared with more than one port,
so it is better to introduce power domain to the problem. Looks
generic_pm_domain is overkill, so I introduced power controller which
only focuses on power on/off and being shared by multiple devices.
