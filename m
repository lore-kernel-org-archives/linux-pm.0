So as I suggested it in the previous mail, the right solution would be to pass in 
the randomization seed via a new kasl_seed=xyz boot option, and thus have the same 
addresses as prior hibernation.

That should make hibernation work as-is, with very little effort.

Two details I can think of:

1) the new option has to be hidden from /proc/cmdline, due to:

  triton:~/tip> ll /proc/cmdline
  -r--r--r-- 1 root root 0 Apr  6 23:45 /proc/cmdline

2)

another detail is that the new boot option has to be checked in 
choose_kernel_location(), to make sure it's done at the right point during bootup. 
That's a good place to remove it from the boot options string as well.

Thanks,

	Ingo
