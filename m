Sure, that's a better name.

Yes.

That might work out better, but there will be a substantial amount of
code duplication.  Try it and see how it turns out.

Exactly.  That was intentional.

The patch does that.

By "do not avoid sleeping", do you mean that 

	(1) the helper functions should be allowed to sleep, or

	(2) the callbacks should be invoked with interrupts enabled?

The patch already does (1).  By contrast, (2) isn't safe.  It means
there is a risk of having one thread do a busy-wait with interrupts
disabled, waiting for another thread that can sleep.

That's not a bad idea, but I don't know if it's necessary in practice.  
With the current patch, if you violate this condition you will simply
encounter an error when the PM core refuses to resume a sleeping
parent.  Maybe we should allow violations and the resulting refusals
but print a warning message in the system log.

There are some subtle aspects related to the interplay between idle and
the other callbacks.  In principle, the idle and suspend callbacks
doesn't need to have interrupts disabled -- we don't care if interrupt
handlers can't do synchronous suspends; they only need synchronous
resumes.  But I wanted to keep things simple, so I treated all the
callbacks the same.

Going further, I'm still a little dubious about the whole point of
having idle notifications at all.  I don't see why the PM core can't
notify a subsystem that a device is idle just by calling the
runtime_suspend routine.  The routine doesn't have to suspend if it
doesn't want to, and it can always schedule a delayed suspend or an
autosuspend.  Maybe you know of a use case where having explicit idle
notifications really does help, but I can't think of any.


One more thing: I'm not sure we really need the "notify" variable in
rpm_suspend.  When a suspend callback fails, it means the device is in
use.  Whatever is using the device should then be responsible for
sending its own idle notification when it is finished; we shouldn't
need to send a notification as soon as the suspend callback fails.

Also, this can theoretically lead to nasty loops.  Suspend callback
fails, idle notification gets sent, the runtime_idle routine tries to
do another pm_runtime_suspend, rinse and repeat...  This is made even
worse by the fact that the rpm_idle call after a failed suspend isn't
asynchronous -- you could overflow the kernel's stack.  Relying on the
driver to be properly written doesn't help: The device could become
busy when each suspend is about to begin, and it could become inactive
again just before the idle notification.  The driver could do the right 
thing at each step and still overflow the stack.
