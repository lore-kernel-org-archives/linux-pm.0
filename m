You get here only if runtime PM is disabled, right?  So the rpm_idle 
call won't do anything -- "disabled" means don't make any callbacks.

Tony, exactly what are you trying to do here?  Do you want this to 
invoke a runtime-PM callback in the subsystem, power domain, or driver?  
(Is there even a driver bound to the device when this function runs?)

The function's name suggests that it merely resets the data stored in 
dev->power without actually touching the hardware.  Is that what you 
really want?
