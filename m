^^^ Then again, this must be fixed not at thermal core. And re-reading
the history of this thread, this seams to be really something broken at
OMAP/DRA7, as mentioned in previous messages. That is probably why you
are pushing for pm_power_off(), which seams to be the one that works for
you, pulling the plug correctly (DRA7).

Actually, Alan's suggestion is more for you to define a
thermal_poweroff() that can be defined per architecture.

Also, please, keep track of your patch versions and also do copy
everybody who has stated their opinion on previous discussions. These
patches must have Ingo, Alan, and RMK copied too. In this way we avoid
loosing track of what has been suggested and we also converge faster to
something everybody (or most of us) agree. Next version, please, fix
that.


To me, thermal core needs a function that simply powers off the system.
No timeouts, delayed works, backups, etc. Simple and straight.

The idea of having a per architecture implementation, as per Alan's
suggestion, makes sense to me too. Having something different from
pm_power_off(), specific to thermal, might also give the opportunity to
save the power off reason.

BR,

Eduardo Valentin
