Perhaps this is what we should do.  If probing gets deferred a few 
times, doing runtime suspends and resumes in between will be a waste of 
time.

?  pm_runtime_put_sync() _already_ does not respect the autosuspend 
mode.  If you want to respect it, you have to call 
pm_runtime_put_sync_autosuspend() instead.

Given the above, this seems unnecessary.
