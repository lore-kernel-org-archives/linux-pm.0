OK, so let's clarify things.

I'm not sure what you mean by "exposing per-device wakeup latency constraints
to user space".  I simply thought it might be useful to allow user space to
add and remove those, in analogy to what it can do with the currently available
PM QoS constraints.

My point is that this won't prevent kernel subsystems from adding their
own PM QoS constraints to devices and the constraints added by user space
will only have effect if they make the devices stay active for longer
times.  In consequence, they may only increase the energy usage of the system
and shouldn't affect functionality.

The reason why I think this may be useful is that I can readily imagine
scenarios in which user space (think a distribution or system vendor) will
want to do something that hasn't been anticipated by kernel developers
and the ability to add per-device PM QoS constraints will allow it to do that
without modifying the kernel.  Also, it will help to test and debug new drivers
and subsystems.

I don't want to prevent kernel subsystems from using their own interfaces to
acquire user-level input that translates into PM QoS constraints.  I simply
think it won't _hurt_ to provide user space with an additional level of
control over per-device PM QoS constraints.

The _end_ users really don't care.  They'll use whatever settings the user
interface exposes to them.  Moreover, even if there is an interface for
user space to add per-device PM QoS constraints, that doesn't mean the
user space is _required_ to use it.  If it doesn't, everything will work
as you describe.

As I said, I don't think we can prevent that from happening anyway.
Worst case people will add strange interfaces to drivers making them
incompatible with anything except for their crazy user space.

Thanks,
