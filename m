Sry, but have you tried test I've proposed (I can't try it by myself now, sry)? 
There is not only iio channel can be a problem - for example "current_worker"
 initialized after IRQ request, but can be scheduled from IRQ handler.

Few words regarding devm_request_irq() - it's useful, from one side, and
dangerous form another :(, as below init sequence is proved to be unsafe
and so it has to be used very carefully:

probe() {
 <do some initialization>
 <create some object:> objX = create_objX() -- no devm
 devm_request_irq(IrqY) -- IrqY handler using objX

 <init step failed>
	goto err;
...

err:
 [a]
 release_objX() - note IRQ is still enabled here
}
dd_core if err:
 devres_release_all() - IRQ disabled and freed only here

remove() {
 [b]
 release_objX() -- note IRQ is still enabled here
}
dd_core:
 devres_release_all() - IRQ disabled and freed only here

IRQ has to be explicitly disabled at points [a] & [b] 

Sequence to move forward can be up to you in general,
personally I'd try to add devm_iio and move  devm_request_irq()
down right before "/* Enable interrupts now. */" line first.
