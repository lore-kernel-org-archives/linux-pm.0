Let me have look again, I might be able to pick up at least some of
the changes in $subject series. No matter what, please re-post once
4.16 rc1 is out.

The reason for being conservative, is that I would prefer the
discussion [1] to conclude on how to handle out/in band wakeups, as
that would help to understand the final goal of $subject series.

Kind regards
