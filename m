That's right, but I don't want to revert all of it.  The other parts
of it are kind of useful as they make the handling of the devices_kset
list be consistent with the handling of dpm_list.

The hunk I'm reverting, however, is completely off.  It not only is
incorrect (as per the above), but it also causes the devices_kset list
and dpm_list to be handled differently.

It had attempted to fix something, but it failed miserably at that.
