No, the NHI driver is bound to the NHI, that's a PCI device sitting on
a bus behind Downstream Bridge 0.

E.g. on a MacBookPro11,3 with a Falcon Ridge 4C it looks like this:

Upstream Bridge:
	06:00.0 PCI bridge [0604]: Intel Corporation Device [8086:156d]
	Bus: primary=06, secondary=07, subordinate=6c, sec-latency=0
Downstream Bridges:
	07:00.0 PCI bridge [0604]: Intel Corporation Device [8086:156d]
	Bus: primary=07, secondary=08, subordinate=08, sec-latency=0
	07:03.0 PCI bridge [0604]: Intel Corporation Device [8086:156d]
	Bus: primary=07, secondary=09, subordinate=39, sec-latency=0
	07:04.0 PCI bridge [0604]: Intel Corporation Device [8086:156d]
	Bus: primary=07, secondary=3a, subordinate=3a, sec-latency=0
	07:05.0 PCI bridge [0604]: Intel Corporation Device [8086:156d]
	Bus: primary=07, secondary=3b, subordinate=6b, sec-latency=0
	07:06.0 PCI bridge [0604]: Intel Corporation Device [8086:156d]
	Bus: primary=07, secondary=6c, subordinate=6c, sec-latency=0
NHI:
	08:00.0 System peripheral [0880]: Intel Corporation Device [8086:156c]
	Subsystem: Device [2222:1111]

There's a bus in-between, bus 07 in the example above.
Buses are signified by a vertical line in this ascii drawing.

The NHI knows when something is plugged in, it talks to the switches
in devices that are hotplugged to the controller. As I've explained
in the lengthy comment in the middle of patch [4/4], we acquire a
runtime pm ref for each switch that is plugged in and release one
whenever a switch is unplugged.

How? The structure is predetermined by the way the PCI devices and
bridges are connected to each other. That was Intel's idea.
