I believe you are referring to the work done by Viresh Kumar (CCed),
specifically the 2 series "[RFC V1 0/8] CPUFreq: create platform-dev
for DT based cpufreq drivers" and "[RFC] OPP: Redefine bindings to
overcome shortcomings". So far the new code has not appeared in
linux-next. If it does, I will happily use it.
