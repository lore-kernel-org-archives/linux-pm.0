There is no del_disk in the kernel.  Let's be more specific (and
accurate!) about the hang.  I assume it's
mmc_remove_card->device_del->kobject_uevent?

Yes, I'd have thought that it would be a good idea for the
kobject_uevent code (or lower, in call_usermodehelper) to take avoiding
action if userspace is frozen.  However such action would probably
involve doing a WARN_ON() too, so we'd still need MMC changes to avoid
that.
