No, we can't force vendors to fix their ACPI tables.  This is completely
unrealistic.

We simly need to deal with the bugs in the ACPI tables in the kernel.

As I said to Al, we need those checks in firmware test suites.  Having
them in the kernel is OK too, but they should cause warnings to be printed
to the kernel log instead of causing the kernel to panic.
