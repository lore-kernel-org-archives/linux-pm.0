Well, it depends on what you mean by "slot" and "child device", but if
my understanding of it is correct, WAKE# actually is "owned" by the
latter.

First, let me clarify the terminology.  PCI slots are not really
represented in the device hierarchy in Linux.  They are represented by
kernel objects for hotplug purposes, but these objects are not based
on struct device.

Generally, there are two kinds of PCI entities represented by struct
pci_dev, bridges and endpoints (functions).  Bridges may represent
physical devices, like PCI-to-PCI bridges, or parts of physical
devices, like PCIe ports.  In PCIe, every port is logically
represented by a bridge (and a PCI config space region with a Type 1
header).  However, ports do not take actions like generating
interrupts; the pieces of hardware containing them (switches, Root
Complex) do that.

Endpoints (functions) are children of bridges (e.g. PCIe ports) and
bridges may be children of other bridges (like in a switch that is
represented by a bus segment with one upstream bridge - the upstream
port - and possibly multiple downstream bridges - downstream ports).
So in PCI a parent always is a bridge (either a PCI bridge - a bridge
between to PCI bus segments - or a host bridge) and if that is a PCIe
port, it cannot "own" anything like WAKE#, because it is not affected
by it in any way and doesn't take part in the handling of it.

In the context of "Figure 5-4" in the spec, Case 1, what matters is
that every "Slot" in the figure represents a bunch (up to 8) of
endpoints (functions), but the "Slot" is not the parent of them.  The
port of the switch the "Slot" is connected to is the parent.  WAKE#
basically comes from one of the endpoints belonging to the "Slot" and
you need to look into the config space regions for all of these
endpoints to check which one has PME Status set and clear it (to
acknowledge the PME and make the hardware stop asserting the WAKE#
signal).  So, from the software perspective, the endpoint (child) is
the source of WAKE# and that should be reflected by DT properties IMO.

There should be no need for that regardless.  You only need an
interrupt handler that will look for the endpoint with PME Status set,
acknowledge it and possibly invoke runtime PM for the endpoint in
question (if supported).  All of that is standard and can happen at
the bus type level and the interrupt handler I'm talking about may be
based on pci_pme_wakeup() or pci_acpi_wake_dev().

Well, it is not in the sense that the endpoint driver is not expected
to handle the wakeup interrupt by itself.  The PCI bus type is
responsible for that, but technically WAKE# comes from the endpoint
(child).

Which doesn't exist.

No, you need a wakeirq properly for the child *device* and that
property will be consumed by the PCI layer.

Right.

Right.

It actually has to walk the bus below each of them too in case it is a
bridge, like pci_acpi_wake_dev().

OK, thanks!
