Hmm, I think I missed the .setup_host_bridge() stuff. So you do handle
both. I'll have to take a little closer look tomorrow. But you
definitely at least need to improve the documentation as mentioned.

Another odd thing about this series is that the interrupt doesn't
actually show up in /proc/interrupts, /sys/kernel/debug/gpio, or
similar, seemingly because the wakeirq is requested/released every time
we suspend/resume. So it's really not that obvious that the interrupt is
being configured properly. That's not really a functional problem,
necessarily, but it doesn't quite seem ideal.

Brian
