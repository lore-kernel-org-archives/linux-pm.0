Shubhrajyoti,
there is no real difference for our system. this is just to keep
back-compatible with old mmc_driver.suspend() since the function
accepts a PMSG_xxx as param.
i think all things go well if we add freeze/thaw/restore in Dmitry
Shmidt's "[PATCH V4] mmc: Set suspend/resume bus operations if
CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME is used"
