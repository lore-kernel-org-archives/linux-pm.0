Hi All,

This is a follow-up for the first part of the PM driver flags series
sent previously some time ago with an intro as follows:

I promised to send the rest of the series then:

and here it goes.

It actually only adds support for one additional flag, namely for
DPM_FLAG_LEAVE_SUSPENDED, to the PM core (basic bits), PCI bus type and the
ACPI PM domain.

That part of the series (patches [1-3/6]) is rather straightforward and, as PCI
and the ACPI PM domain are concerned, it should be functionally equivalent to
the previous version of the set, so I retained the Greg's ACKs on these patches.

The other part (patches [4-6/6]) is sort of new, as it makes the PM core
carry out optimizations for devices with DPM_FLAG_LEAVE_SUSPENDED and/or
DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND set where the "noirq", "early" and "late" system-wide
PM callbacks provided by the drivers are invoked by the core directly.  That
part basically allows platform drivers, for instance, to reuse runtime PM
callbacks (by pointing ->suspend_late and ->resume_early to them) without
adding extra checks to them, as long as they are called directly by the core
(or the ACPI PM domain).

The series should apply on top of linux-next from today.

Thanks,
Rafael
