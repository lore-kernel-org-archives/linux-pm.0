I suppose this request is sent after calling function driver's suspend
callback? BTW, what request is it?

Yes, and this is guaranteed by PM core as the function device is the
child of the card device.

Exactly.

That would be good. I do not have any SDIO card at hand, but I would be
glad to review the patch.

Thanks,
