It doesn't have to be actively avoided then.  restore_jump_address is
a kernel text address and if __PAGE_OFFSET is the same for both the
restore and image kernels, it is guaranteed to be above the identity
mapping in both of them.

If the base of the identity mapping is randomized in both of them,
though, that may not be guaranteed any more.

It should not, but it's not impossible for it to happen every time, at
least in a small number of attempts.

Thanks,
