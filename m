Currently we saw a lot of "No irq handler" errors during hibernation,
which caused the system hang finally:

[  710.141581] ata4.00: qc timeout (cmd 0xec)
[  710.147135] ata4.00: failed to IDENTIFY (I/O error, err_mask=0x4)
[  710.154593] ata4.00: revalidation failed (errno=-5)
[  710.468124] ata4: SATA link up 6.0 Gbps (SStatus 133 SControl 300)
[  710.477746] do_IRQ: 31.151 No irq handler for vector

According to above logs, there is an interrupt triggered and it is
dispatched to CPU31 with a vector number 151, but there is no handler
for it, thus this irq will not get acked and caused irq flood which kill
the system. To be more specific, the 31.151 is an interrupt from the ahci
host controller.

After some investigation, the reason why this issue is triggered is
because the thaw_noirq() function does not restore the MSI/MSIX settings
across hibernation.

The scenario is illustrated below:

1. Before the hibernation starts, the irq 34 is the handler for the ahci device,
   which is binded on cpu31.
2. Hibernation starts, the ahci device is put into low power state.
3. All the nonboot CPUs are put offline, so the irq 34 has to be migrated to
   the last alive one - CPU0.
4. After the snapshot has been created, all the nonboot CPUs are brought up again,
   the CPU affinity for IRQ 34 remains to be 0.
5. ahci device are put into D0.
6. The snapshot is written to the disk.

The issue is triggered in step 6, in theory the ahci interrupt should be
delivered to CPU0, however the actually result is that this interrupt is
delivered to the original CPU31 instead, which cause the "No irq handler" issue.

Ying Huang has has provided a clue that, in step 3 it is possible that the writing
to the register might not take effect as the PCI devices have been put suspended.
Actually it is true:
In step 3, the irq 34 affinity is supposed to be modified from 31 to 0,
but actually it did not. In __pci_write_msi_msg(), if the device is already
in low power state, the low level msi message entry will not be updated
but cached. So in theory during the device restore process, the cached msi
modification information should be written back to the hardware, and this
is what pci_restore_msi_state() do during normal suspend-resume.
But this is not the case for hibernation, pci_restore_msi_state() is not
invoked currently, to be more specific, pci_restore_state() is not invoked
in pci_pm_thaw_noirq(), although pci_save_state() has saved the necessary
pci cached information in pci_pm_freeze_noirq().

This patch tries to restore the pci status for the device during hibernation,
otherwise the status might be lost across hibernation(for example, the MSI/MSIX
message settings), which might cause problems during hibernation.
