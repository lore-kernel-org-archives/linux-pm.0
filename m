Referring to my comments in patch 1, what if we end up changing the 
bindings based on DT maintainer comments? We will have these compatible 
strings, and at that point is it acceptable to match against them? Or is 
it still better to match to SoC compatibles? I think it makes sense to 
just probe against these.
