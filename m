Hmm.  I see.

For that to work, the subsystem's .suspend() and .resume() callbacks will
have to be implemented in a special way, because of the unknown runtime PM
status of devices while those callbacks are being executed.

Presumably you think about subsystems that don't implement those callbacks
at all?
