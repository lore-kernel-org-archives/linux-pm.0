Pandaboard has a weird configuration, where MPU VDD is controlled by a 
separate component; TPS62361, but rest of the voltages are provided by 
TWL6030. The support for this was attempted to be upstreamed along with 
the required changes for the VC/VP framework under mach-omap2, but this 
was never accepted.

I'm not sure but I recall it wasn't possible to control the MPU voltage 
via the default I2C interface, instead you had to use the VC/VP path, 
which isn't fully implemented for OMAP4. As a consequence, none of the 
OMAP4 boards have a properly functioning MPU voltage supply control in 
place and you will rely on u-boot provided voltages.
