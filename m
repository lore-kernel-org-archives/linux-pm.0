yes - if we do have a documented subset of OPPs that are valid for all
"variants" of AM437x, we could add that in using the legacy bindings,
but, we will have to do a transition over to the new bindings when
they are finalized to support all OPPs appropriately.

While I do agree that there is always a debate between fixing things
in kernel for bootloader issues, but it does not mean that we should
just postpone fixing the bootloader in this case - since, at this very
moment, we are already in broken configuration - example sitting on a
bootloader shell does have the same impact we have at this time.

Lets try to help Viresh in getting his series sorted out meanwhile -
maybe others can help as well :(
