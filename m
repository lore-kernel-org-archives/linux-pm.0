So I tested the first version, with that my WSM-EP didn't resume on WoL
and pressing the power button after the WoL had it crash and burn in the
igb driver.

Today I tested this latest version and WoL still didn't trigger a
resume, but the power button did make it go again, no crashes and I
suppose I can confirm the earlier patch that stopped making it go halt
works.

When I 'halt' I can wake the machine back up using a WoL so that all
_should_ work afaik.
