Yeah, and I'm sure there were good reasons at the time.

Heh, no worries.

Yes, the musb patch I mentioned is only needed when the ancestor device
controlling the clock is runtime suspended when going into system
suspend. With an active port, suspend works without it also on BBB.

Thanks for testing.
