Again, depends on the hardware. If it is basically a single interrupt
line - then yes, you need to wake up the whoke device (although I have
an idea at the very back of my queue about alowing consumers to
subscribe to certain events so that userspace does not get woken up for
events it does not care about).

If there are several interrupts available you can partition the device
into several components.

Yes, of course. I used "kick" to add some flavor to this conversation, the
API is of course should only provide ways to do "request".

Right. I expect that standard screen/keyboard autosuspend shoudl be in
10s of seconds (30-60 i guess) but users might accelerate suspending by
pressing a button. Or software might do the same for userspace when
proximity sensor fires up.

I think we agree that it should read "request devices go into different
power state".
