I wasn't referring to suspend blockers, but to the idea of initiating full
system suspend from idle, which I still think makes sense.  If you are
waiting for an interrupt that cannot wake you from suspend, then
_obviously_ suspend should not be started.  However, if you're not waiting =
for
such an interrupt and the (a) and (b) above hold, it makes sense to start
suspend from idle.
