Thanks for the great reviews.. It did bump up the resultant patch.

pr_fmt has been reformatted for this. The actual message which will appear
is as follows:
opp_set_availability: Unable to allocate opp

is'nt that good enough considering that all functions are opp_ prefixed? 
I can modify pr_fmt to add "OPP:" but I kinda think it is redundant. But I
have no strong opinions on that and look forward to your recommendations.

Ack. Fixing in v6 if you are ok with the above.
