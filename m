As I explained in some other mail, those tables should not be
neccessary at all. They can be computed from li-ion characteristics
and internal resistance, and assumed current during charge and
discharge.

Running below 3.3V.. not really. At that point, the battery is really
_empty_, and voltage is going down really really fast.

Plus, you are damaging the battery at that point.
