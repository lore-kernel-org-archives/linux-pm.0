I'm not sure how much sense that distinction makes.  It seems to me the
only time you want to ignore potential wakeup events is if you want to
ignore _all_ input.  Which is basically what "inhibit" means.

This suggests we forget about power/wakeup == "off" and introduce an 
"inhibit" attribute instead.

It could be a separate attribute, or it could be a new entry for
power/control.  Come to think of it, a separate attribute might be
better.  Otherwise we would lose track of whether runtime suspend was
permitted (the "on" vs. "auto" distinction) when the device was
inhibited.  I can imagine someone might want to forbid runtime suspend
but still inhibit a device.

However, I agree that there's no point registering a separate attribute
or accepting a write of "inhibit" to power/control if there's no
corresponding callback.

Well, I suppose there might be a driver that supports inhibit but
doesn't support runtime PM, unlikely as that seems.  Or the driver
might support both but the user might leave power/control == "on" while
inhibiting the device.
