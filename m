The latest architecture spec (M.a.a) has working hyperlinks.

Yes, compared to CNTVCT.

Yes, it exits immediately. These counters are not going to wrap in our
(or device's) lifetime.

No but you do need to read CNTVCT, that's what __delay_cycles() does (it
does not wait).

The guard was added recently by commit e5cb94ba5f96 ("arm64: Fix
sampling the "stable" virtual counter in preemptible section"). It's
needed for the udelay() case but probably not for Ankur's series. Maybe
we can move the guard in the caller?

> Looking at the code I think the "sevl; wfe" pair should be higher up.

Yes, I replied to your other message. We could move it higher indeed,
before the condition check, but I can't get my head around the ordering.
Can need_resched() check be speculated before the WFE? I need to think
some more.

WFE is a very shallow power state where all hardware state is retained.
We have an even stream broadcast to all CPUs regularly already (10KHz)
and I haven't heard people complaining about power degradation. If a CPU
is a WFI state or even deeper into firmware (following a PSCI call), an
exclusive monitor event won't wake it up. It's only for those cores
waiting in WFE.
