It's not massively clear to me how much sense that makes for the
embedded case where we've got a much better idea of what happened to the
hardware over suspend.  Note that I'm thinking here mostly of the case
where we've runtime suspended the device, if the kernel thought the
device was powered then it's much clearer that we should do this on
resume.

  * The device's children may need the device to be at full power in
    order to resume themselves.

Right, this does need to be handled - I'd expect that in most situations
we'd have sorted through it before we ever enter suspend.

  * The device might need to switch power levels, wake-up settings, etc.
  * Remote wake-up events might have been lost by the firmware.
  * The driver's idea of the device state may not agree with the device's
    physical state.  This can happen during resume from hibernation.
  * The device might need to be reset.

This is all much more under control in the embedded case, and of course
the device does know if it's coming back from suspend or hibernation
IIRC which seems to be the only difficult case.

  * Even though the device was suspended, if its usage counter was > 0 then most
    likely it would need a run-time resume in the near future anyway.

Presumably in that case it wouldn't be runtime suspended anyway, or we'd
otherwise be able to cope with the situation without actually fully
powering the device?

  * Always going back to full power is simplest.

It's simple, but spending time and power rewriting large numbers of
registers over a slow bus (which is the sort of thing you end up doing
with some devices) or fiddling about with analogue bringup for devices
affected by that only to immediately power it off again isn't terribly
useful either - it's at best slow.

What I'd have expected resume to do is to bring the system back to the
state it was in before we entered suspend.  I've probably got a fairly
odd view of the world here in that I mostly care about big devices
connected over slow buses where power up can be user visible, and mostly
work on subsystems where the concept of "full power" isn't terribly
meaningful.
