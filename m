Here's a list of commits from Thomas that are related to memory randomization.

210e7a43fa90 mm: SLUB freelist randomization
7c00fce98c3e mm: reorganize SLAB freelist randomization
4ff5308744f5 x86/mm: Do not reference phys addr beyond kernel
90397a417796 x86/mm: Add memory hotplug support for KASLR memory randomization
a95ae27c2ee1 x86/mm: Enable KASLR for vmalloc memory regions
021182e52fe0 x86/mm: Enable KASLR for physical mapping memory regions
0483e1fa6e09 x86/mm: Implement ASLR for kernel memory regions
b234e8a09003 x86/mm: Separate variable for trampoline PGD
faa379332f3c x86/mm: Add PUD VA support for physical mapping
59b3d0206d74 x86/mm: Update physical mapping variable names
d899a7d146a2 x86/mm: Refactor KASLR entropy functions

I wonder if it is viable to revert them one by one top-to-bottom and
see which one of them causes things to fail?

Thanks,
Rafael
