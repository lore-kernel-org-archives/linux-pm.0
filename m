I believe I understand why the PM core prevent this. Some subsystems
and drivers depends on this behaviour, but I wonder if we should
consider this as common cases or more like special cases?

For those drivers that potentially could rely on runtime PM (and it's
callbacks) to inactivate the device during system suspend, and thus
don't have issues with races you describe above, the current behaviour
in the PM core adds unnecessary complexity for these drivers to handle
system suspend.

Drivers/buses/power_domains that handles runtime PM enabled devices,
will, as you also have pointed out earlier, need to implement the
.suspend callback (suspend_late or suspend_noirq might work as well)
and the corresponding .resume callback. This just for the sake of
making sure all their runtime enabled devices gets fully inactivated
during system suspend.

I wonder if we somehow should move the responsibility of preventing
"runtime suspend" as a part of the system suspend, down to the driver
to decide instead of the PM core?

Kind regards
