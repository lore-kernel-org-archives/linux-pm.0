Why so?  You can use spin_lock_irqsave/spin_unclock_irqrestore  to
avoid that.

OK, but this way you practically make the users of the framework duplicate
some code for the locking purposes.  This is kind of suboptimal, and error
prone too.

Well, my point is, since the _final_ set of OPPs doesn't really change, there's
no need to use a list for storing it in principle.

Your current algorithm seems to be:
(1) Create a list of all _possible_ OPPs.
(2) Mark the ones that can actually be used on the given hardware as
    "available".
(3) Whenever we need to find an OPP to use, browse the entire list.

This isn't optimal, because the OPPs that are not marked as "available" in (2)
will never be used, although they _will_ be inspected while browsing the list.
So, I think a better algorithm would be:
(1) Create a list of all possible OPPs.
(2) Drop the nonavailable OPPs from the list.
(3) Whenever we need to find an OPP to use, browse the entire list.

But then, it may be better to simply move the list we get in (2) into an
array, because the browsing is going to require fewer memory accesses in
that case (also, an array would use less memory than the list).  So, perhaps,
it's better to change the algorithm even further:
(1) Create a list of all possible OPPs.
(2) Drop the nonavailable OPPs from the list.
(3) Move the list we got in (2) into a sorted array.
(4) Whenever we need to find an OPP to use, browse the array
     (perhaps using binary search).

Thanks,
Rafael
