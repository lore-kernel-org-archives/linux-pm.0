Even if the parent is not always kept active, it should still be active
during a system resume.  Starting from the time its resume routine
runs, it should remain at full power until the system resume is 
finished.

Do you mean a host controller and a peripheral controller?

So what?  There are lots of ways of avoiding such crashes.  (Disabling
the driver entirely, for example.)  They aren't relevant for this
discussion.

Why would the parent be runtime suspended?  Why wouldn't it still be in
the full-power state, the way its own resume routine should have left
it?

Maybe I'm being slow and dumb here, but I don't see how any of this 
answers the question I raised earlier.
