Here's a v2 which is very similar to the previous one, except for 3 things:
- There are few build fixes in the last patch.
- The patch from Hans mentioned previously is included now (as [7/8]).
- There is an additional PCI change related to config space saving/restoring
  and PME.

If anyone has any objections or concerns regarding this, please speak up now,
as I'm going to put it into linux-next shortly to allow it to receive some more
testing than commit eed4d47efe95 had had before it went it.

Thanks,
Rafael
