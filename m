Right.

That said whether or not it is ever useful to set PM_RUNTIME alone is a good
question.  In my opinion it is useful today, at least on some platforms that
don't really support system suspend or hibernation in any form.  However, it
may not be the case any more when suspend-to-idle becomes mature enough,
because that should just work for any platform without any kind of special
support.  We're still missing some timekeeping bits there, but once that
gap has been covered, we may just eliminate PM_SLEEP as well if there's a
broad consensus on that.
