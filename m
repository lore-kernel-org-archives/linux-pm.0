I'd rather not get the hardware state out of sync with PM runtime..

Well we actually pretty much have devices in that state to start
with.

The problem is that the hardware state gets out of sync with
PM runtime. And that's going to be a pain to debug later on.

Yeah not sure what the right fix is. But I'd rather patch the
few drivers using autosuspend if we come to the conclusion
that there is no bug in PM runtime.

And I don't like it because of the reasons above :) But yeah
gave it a quick try and that too works as expected.
