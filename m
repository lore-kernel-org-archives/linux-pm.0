evil_data_writer will enter refrigerator after invoking 'try_to_freeze'. This 
should be followed by a call to kthread_should_stop. There it decides if it 
needs to exit the thread (after cleanups if necessary) or not. I have seen that
the bdi_writeback_task function is like that. It does not care if there is 
pending data to be written if it detects that someone have invoked a 
'kthread_stop' on it. It simply exits. I have seen some other kernel threads 
that do not follow this and I think that probably is not right.
