Yes, but what does it extend? What aspect it makes the current suspend
model better in?

That's implementation specific. If CPUIdle implemented CPU deep sleep,
I bet you would see different figures.

You don't quite get it :) This should NOT at all be timeout driven.
This should be activity driven or constraint driven which perfectly
fits into the runtime PM paradigm but is in no way cleanly implemented
within the "pure" Android PM.
