Hi,

After commit b2b49ccbdd54 "PM: Kconfig: Set PM_RUNTIME if PM_SLEEP is
selected" (currently in Linux next) CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME is set whenever
CONFIG_PM is set, so CONFIG_PM can be used in #ifdefs instead of
CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME which simplifies things in quite a few cases.

For this reason, the following patches modify some core code to use
CONFIG_PM instead of CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME.

[1/4] Drop a macro which is redundant after the above commit.
[2/4] Use PM instead of PM_RUNTIME in the core device PM code.
[3/4] Use PM instead of PM_RUNTIME in the ACPI core.
[4/4] Use PM instead of PM_RUNTIME in the PCI core.

They build for me for all of the relevant combinations of options (on x86),
but more testing (on the other architectures) would be welcome.

Thanks!
