From: Rafael J. Wysocki <rafael.j.wysocki@intel.com>

If a PCI bridge (or PCIe port) that is runtime-suspended gets an
ACPI hotplug notification, such as a bus check, it has to be resumed
before re-scanning the devices below it, or those devices will not
be accessible and will be treated as hot-removed.

Make that happen and let the bridge suspend again after the bus
below it has been re-scanned.

This is a replacement for commit 16468c783cb4 (ACPI / hotplug / PCI:
Runtime resume bridge before rescan) that has been reverted,
because it introduced a system resume regression (due to missing
bridge->pci_dev checks that are necessary in case the notification
is targeted at the host bridge) and it is necessary for the code
added by commit 006d44e49a25 (PCI: Add runtime PM support for PCIe
ports) to work as expected.
