The sti-cpufreq driver in v4.8-rc7 appears to do what I am already doing 
in this revision of the patch, reading from a syscon phandle that is 
part of the cpu node in the DT which is what I was told not to do.

The register I am referencing in the syscon is a bit-field describing 
which OPPs are valid for the system, so it is very relevant to the OPP 
binding. They really are already present in a separate node, I'm just 
indexing into a syscon, same as the sti-cpufreq driver appears to be doing.
