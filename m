Could you explain in some detail of why the second part makes sense?

To me it seems more clever to leave the decision to the driver,
whether it wants to resume the device during system resume or if
rather wants to defer that to later, via runtime PM.

The above seems reasonable, but on the other hand it makes it more
difficult to understand how the DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND is going to be
used.

Perhaps we should simply have a separate flag for the resume path?

Please check the return value from pm_runtime_set_active(), else we
might not know if something went wrong. For example, the parent may
not be active.

Moreover, as stated above, perhaps this should be controlled by a separate flag?

My overall comment/concern with this flag is that I would like a more
straightforward approach, else people want understand how to use of
it.

Moreover doesn't this flag actually overlap quite closely with what
the direct_complete path is already doing? Except for the resume path
- of course.

Kind regards
