I am only thinking of wakeup event. (And I am only thinking of suspend as
initiated by writing 'mem' to /sys/power/state.)
I agree that non-wakeup events can easily be delayed by suspend, and this is
by design and no-one wants it to change.

This is exactly the issue.  Linux doesn't get this right.  A wakeup that is
processed by the driver just before suspend may not get all the way out to
it's final destination (possibly in meat-space) until after some other event
wakes the device.  It is not possible to guarantee full delivery of a wakeup
event with Linux in its current state.  This is a bug.

I don't think I'm missing that.  Wakeup events are the only events of
interest.  But wakeup events are more than just low-level hardware events.
They are also the virtual events that are a direct consequence of the
original hardware event.
A UART asserts 'data ready' which is routed to an IO interrupt line that
wakes the device.  This is a wakeup event.
So are the bits that appear on the data line which represent the data
So are the characters that appear on the serial port
So is the "here is a message from the GSM processor" event
So is the "there is a new TXT message" event
So is the "'beep beep beep' out the speaker" event

All these events are wakeup events, and should abort or instant-resume the
system.  Currently only the first can be guaranteed to do this (... and maybe
the second, depending on the details of the implementation).
suspend-blocks effectively pass a lock from one event to the next to ensure
that all of these event block the suspend.  There are various other ways to
achieve the same thing, and I think it can be done with no significant change
to the API.  But some how we need to allow all of these events to be
linked wake-up events, not just the first one.
