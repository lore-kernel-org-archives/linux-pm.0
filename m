Not asynchronous runtime resume, because the workqueue is frozen.  But 
that's not the issue here.

Calling the runtime_suspend method directly is the way to do it.

Hmm.  The pm_runtime_suspended() check may not be needed (if A were
suspended already then B would have encountered problems).  But
including it doesn't hurt.

Using the _noirq method isn't a good idea, unless you know for certain 
that the runtime_suspend handler doesn't need to sleep.  Using the 
normal suspend method should work okay, because B always has to suspend 
before A.

This isn't clear to me.  Isn't the driver registered on the bus in 
question?  Can't the driver therefore call the bus's runtime_suspend 
routine directly, instead of dereferencing the bus->pm->runtime_suspend 
pointer?
