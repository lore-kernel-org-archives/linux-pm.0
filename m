That is what encrypted STD does.

No, that is out of scope for Secure Boot

Well, this has no relation to Secure Boot.
Secure Boot will not prevent you from booting the machine.
It restricts the OS you can boot to a cryptographically signed subset.

If you want to demand a password to resume a machine, you can
do so. But it has no relation to encrypted STD, other than that
you need encrypted STD for this to make sense.

Secure Boot has no concept of users. Code is trusted, not users.
For Secure Boot to work, you need a key generated and RAM encrypted
in kernel space.

If you want a requirement to restrict booting or resuming, you need
to encrypt the key. These are different things.
