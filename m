Just for a bit of light amusement, although hopefully we've killed the
meme that other platforms have absolutely no problems in this area
without using something like suspend blockers, I offer for your
consideration this thread from maemo-developers:

http://lists.maemo.org/pipermail/maemo-developers/2010-May/026490.html

Note how users conflate battery lifetime after downloading a random
application with the platform being "stable".  I also was amazed that
the thread degenerated into trying to detect processes that are taking
90% of the CPU.  It's not necessary for a process to be constantly
running before it starts chewing up your battery, and if people think
the "blame the victim" trick works (``It's the user's fault for
"approving" the application by installing it!''), I suspect that
the platform will be not be very successful...
