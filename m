Yeah noticed..

I'd like to have pm_runtime_put_sync() disable the hardware after
the initial failed probe. Currently that does not happen unless
pm_runtime_dont_use_autosuspend() is called before pm_runtime_put_sync().

Yes so far that's the only fix that seems to work like I posted
earlier. But is that the right fix though?

If we wanted to have some generic fix, it seems we would have to pass
a new flag in pm_runtime_put_sync() to ignore any autosuspend
configuration. But I don't know if that's what we want to or should
do though?
