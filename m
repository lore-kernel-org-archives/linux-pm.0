Well not quite correct. After failed probe PM runtime is set to reset
state while hardware is still enabled.

It is really best to disable the hardware after a failed probe
like we do with pm_runtime_put_sync_(suspend)() and pm_runtime_disable().

This is because there may never be another probe attempt and we want
to have unclaimed devices shut off (or idled) for PM.

Certainly that should at least produce a warning in the hardware
specific implementation. It's a state mismatch between PM runtime
and the hardware specific implementation.

And as discussed, the problem does not exist as long as we understand
that we need to use pm_runtime_put_sync_suspend() if the driver has
set pm_runtime_use_autoidle(). Or else use the combination of
pm_runtime_dont_use_autoidle() and pm_runtime_put_sync().

Nothing, unless a state needs to be maintained for things like GPIO
pins power memory :)
