To summarize the next steps. I will send new version of the
PCI PM patches with following changes.

  - Drop this 50ms patch, we should have the PCIe 100ms delay already
    covered.

  - Increase runtime PM autosuspend time from 10ms to 500ms (or whatever
    is the prefered default).

  - Add new version of ACPI hotplug patch where pm_runtime_get/put() is
    moved into acpiphp_check_bridge().

Let me know if I'm forgetting something.

Bjorn, is this ok for you? It would be nice to get the updated series to
linux-next for wider testing :)
