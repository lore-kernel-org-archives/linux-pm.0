Unfortunately true.  I've had a couple of reports to look at and think
through apart from this; it's really quite fascinating how much stuff
a slightly stricter table check is turning up.  A little surprising,
too, but fascinating.  A fix is in progress, still needs some testing...

Yup.  Agreed.  For x86, we can't induce kernel panics.  Since arm64 is new to
the game, we'll be stricter since we can afford to be for now.
