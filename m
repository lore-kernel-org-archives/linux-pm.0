Applied both with Rafael's acks to for-linus for v4.6.

The rationale is that ab1a187bba5c ("PCI: Check device_attach() return
value always") appeared in v4.6-rc1, and after that commit, plugging
in a Thunderbolt device while the system is asleep will cause a BUG()
when the system is awakened.

Lukas, you mentioned earlier that we might want to include Andreas'
patch "thunderbolt: Fix double free of drom buffer" at the same time.
I did apply that on pci/thunderbolt for v4.7.  I can move that to
for-linus and put it in v4.6 if necessary, but that bug been there
since v3.17.  Is there something in v4.6 that makes us more likely to
hit that double free?
