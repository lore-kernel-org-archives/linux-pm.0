Quoting from the above:

"This patch series focuses on addressing those problems so as to make it
easier to reuse callback routines by pointing different callback pointers
to them in device drivers.  The flags introduced here are to instruct the
PM core and middle layers (whatever they are) on how the driver wants the
device to be handled and then the driver has to provide callbacks to match
these instructions and the rest should be taken care of by the code above it."

I'm not sure what I can explain beyond that. :-)

And the i2c-designware-platdrv and intel-lpss patches show the direction
I would like to take with that going forward: use the flags to reduce code
duplication in drivers and between drivers.

60 is a small number relative to the total number of device drivers in
the tree.  In particular, that scheme is totally unsuitable for PCI drivers
and how many of them there are?  Surely more than 60.

These functions are wrong, however, because they attempt to reuse the
whole callback *path* instead of just reusing driver callbacks.  The
*only* reason why it all "works" is because there are no middle layer
callbacks involved in that now.

If you changed them to reuse driver callbacks only today, nothing would break
AFAICS.

For the time being, nothing changes in that respect, but eventually I'd
prefer the pm_runtime_force_* things to go away, frankly.

I didn't mean "reusing runtime PM callbacks for system-wide PM" overall, but
reusing *middle-layer* runtime PM callbacks for system-wide PM.  That is the
bogus part.

Quoting again:

"If you are a middle layer, your role is basically to do PM for a certain
group of devices.  Thus you cannot really do the same in ->suspend or
->suspend_early and in ->runtime_suspend (because the former generally need to
take device_may_wakeup() into account and the latter doesn't) and you shouldn't
really do the same in ->suspend and ->freeze (becuase the latter shouldn't
change the device's power state) and so on."

I have said for multiple times that re-using *driver* callbacks actually makes
sense and the series is for doing that easier in general among other things.

Let me turn this around.

The majority of cases in which pm_runtime_force_* are used *should* be
addressable using the flags introduced here.  Some case in which
pm_runtime_force_* cannot be used should be addressable by these flags
as well.

There may be some cases in which pm_runtime_force_* are used that may
require something more, but I'm not going to worry about that right now.

I'll take care of that when I'll be removing pm_runtime_force_*, which I'm
not doing here.

Thanks,
Rafael
