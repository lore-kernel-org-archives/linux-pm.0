It looks like this makes the code significantly simpler, but I haven't
the faintest idea whether this all makes sense or not.

It makes me a little nervous that there doesn't seem to be any spec to
guide this and we are so dependent on the current Linux code
structure.  There seem to be so many assumptions and dependencies that 
it's impractical to review changes in isolation.

So I guess I can only rely on Rafael's review here (as always for PM).

Since the current behavior is fatal to some devices, I guess this
fixes a bug?  Thunderbolt didn't work after system suspend/resume or
something?
