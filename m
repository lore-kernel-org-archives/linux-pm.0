What would the udev rule look like though?

Match for Intel CPU generation (WhiskyLake) and laptop chassis type
and then enable i8042 wakeups? While that seems like the most accurate
reflection of the situation which we are seeing across multiple
vendors, it doesn't feel right and seems unlikely to be accepted by
systemd upstream.

In previous designs, pressing a key while the system was in S3 sleep
would cause a SCI interrupt due to the firing of the EC GPE, which
effectively meant that keyboard wakeups were on by default and could
not be disabled. Also USB keyboards have wakeups on by default (see
usbhid_start()). Just these new platforms have this
unfortunate/accidental behaviour change...

Would it make sense to turn i8042 wakeups on by default on the kernel
side? I don't know if any particular conditions are applied, but that
would appear to be the default Win10 behaviour here.
