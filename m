Why the xarray? Don't page tables (and shmem page cache) just point
directly to the vswap entry the same way they point to swap entries
today?

*looks at the code*

Oh, it's to find the actual cluster because the vswap file can be
sparse? Hmm yeah I guess we can revisit the data structure here later,
but IIRC xarrays aren't particularly good for sparse data. Maybe it's
usually not sprase in practice.

Maybe a maple tree? :)

Yeah we can do that, but it's a blocker for zswap only using vswap.

Maybe it doesn't simplify the code, but if the branching causes
performance overhead we can use static keys. I guess we can still use
static keys per-swapfile, but it would be more complicated.

Anyway, not super important now.
