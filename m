Without handling the IRQ?  I guess if the transient state (SUSPENDING
or RESUMING) ends quickly enough then the kernel won't permanently
disable the IRQ line (although getting hundreds of repeated error
messages in the system log might prove daunting).  Would you want to 
rely on that?

Yes, this probably would be acceptable since it wouldn't happen very 
often.  Still, having two different pathways (one of which is very low 
probability) usually isn't a good idea.

Ah, but once you integrate the runtime PM framework into your driver, 
you run the risk of resumes occurring for reasons that aren't under 
your control.  For example, the user can force a runtime-suspended 
device to resume by writing "on" to the device's power/control sysfs 
attribute.  What would happen if a wakeup IRQ arrived just as the 
resume was starting?

(Actually, this particular failure mode shouldn't concern you very much
since it applies only to SMP systems.  But it's important to think of
the future -- I can imagine SMP OMAPs coming out before too long.)

On the whole, I don't see any striking reason for the PM core not to 
busy-wait during a concurrent state change.  Refusing to wake up a 
suspended parent ... okay, maybe that's a little more defensible.  
Especially since in many or most cases the parent (if there is one) 
will probably be runtime-PM-disabled anyway.
