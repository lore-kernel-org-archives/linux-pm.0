I mean:

- Each omap-control-core.c, bandgap and usb drivers remap SCM window. It's OK because SCM window is statically mapped. So each call of ioremap in omap-control-core.c, bandgap and usb drivers returns the same virtual address. But the problem is that SCM memory window isn't protected. I'm not sure whether it's possible to protect SCM window using this approach(when each driver remaps the same IOMEM).
