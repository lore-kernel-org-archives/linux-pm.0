The comment pertains to:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=53811

It was discussed on April 12/13:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/8782801/

Executive summary:
On non-Macs, Thunderbolt is driven by the firmware in System Management
Mode, on hotplug the CPU receives a Sytem Management Interrupt (SMI) and
jumps to SMM code. This doesn't work reliably if the hotplug port has
been transitioned to D3hot, the SMM code tries to access config space
of hotplugged devices (not possible if port is in D3hot) and is apparently
too dumb to check if the port is in D3hot and wake it up.

On Macs, Thunderbolt is not driven by the firmware except immediately on
boot: It is initially set up by an EFI driver, but once ExitBootServices
has been called, the OS is responsible. Therefore on Macs the hotplug
ports may be suspended to D3hot just fine. This is done by patch
[08/13] of my series "Runtime PM for Thunderbolt on Macs".

This was discussed between April 18 and April 21, please refer to
the above-linked patchwork entry.

I had done some tests and the result was:
"A hotplug port may go to D3hot and will still generate interrupts on
hotplug, but all its parent ports are *not* allowed to go to D3hot
because otherwise the hotplug interrupts will no longer come through.
The algorithm in pci_bridge_d3_update() and pci_dev_check_d3cold()
needs to be amended to take that into account. Hm, it's nontrivial
I guess, allowing bridge_d3 = true for the lowest hotplug bridge in a
hierarchy but not for anything above?"

Mika's reply was:
"If we need to do things like that, it will get pretty complex and we
still cannot be sure whether hotplug works. I think it is safer to go
back to what I already had and disable runtime PM from such ports."

Best regards,

Lukas
