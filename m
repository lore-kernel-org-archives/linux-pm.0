I'm not sure what you mean here.  First, UNIVERSAL_DEV_PM_OPS() actually
does what it says, defines a set of operations to use for system suspend,
hibernation and runtime PM all the same.

My impression is that you and Kevin are talking of different things.

The Kevin's point originally was that it might be desirable to do things
like calling pm_runtime_suspend() from a driver's (system) .suspend()
callback, if I understood it correctly, and the answer was that it wasn't
the right thing to do (for reasons given elsewhere in the thread).

Your point seems to be that simple drivers should not be required to
define separate callback routines, for example, for system suspend and
runtime PM.  However, they aren't required to do so, they can point
all of their "suspend" callback pointers to the same routine, which is
what the UNIVERSAL_DEV_PM_OPS() macro does.

Thanks,
Rafael
