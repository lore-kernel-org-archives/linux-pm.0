Thank you for explaining the motivation to carry out ->prepare top-down.
However my problem is really that ->complete is carried out bottom-up.
What's the motivation for that? Merely to mirror the behaviour of
->prepare? Would it be possible to change it to top-down? Note that
re-enablement of device addition is already allowed in ->resume,
which is called top-down.

By the way, neither the PCI nor USB bus-level ->prepare callbacks perform
any action that would stop device addition. Same for the pciehp driver
(we don't even have a ->prepare callback defined for PCIe port services.
So it *is* possible to hotplug PCI devices after ->prepare.

Best regards,

Lukas
