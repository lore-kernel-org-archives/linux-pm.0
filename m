Hello,

I am trying to understand the relation between HW PWM, and the linux
mechanism (cpuidle and suspend/resume). If you are familiar with the
relations between the 2 I wil appreciate your comments.

For example, are the wakeup source relevant for changing the cpu state
or do they trigger change only if suspend/resume mechanism is used ?
Is the c-state (which is changed by the cpuidle mechanism) relevant
for the state of the cpu only (without the peripheral devices) ?

Thanks,
Ran
