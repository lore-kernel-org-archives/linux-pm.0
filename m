Yes, it does.

I'm still not clear on what you want to accomplish.  It sounds like you 
want to perform a runtime suspend following the last probe (if the 
probe fails), and in between probes you don't really care (although it 
would be preferable to avoid suspending).

Does pm_runtime_use_autosuspend() get called by the probe routine?  If 
it does, then perhaps you can get what you want by having the probe 
routine call pm_runtime_dont_use_autosuspend() whenever it's about to 
return an error -- particularly -EDEFER.

This would prevent pm_runtime_autosuspend() from working correctly.
