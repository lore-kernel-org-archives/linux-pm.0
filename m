Yes.

All 2 and 5 are bugs in the drviers that should be fixed.  Whether or
not 4 is a bug depends on what the bus type does.

There's one more problem here, which is the expectation that drivers should
be responsible for the entire handling of suspend/resume of their devices.
This is misguided, because it forces the knowledge about particular platforms
into the drivers.  Ideally, the suspend and resume of a device should be
divided into a device-specific part handled by the driver and a bus-specific
or platform-specific part handled by the bus type or a PM domain, respectively.
The driver should only be concerned about the device-specific part.

That applies to both system suspend/resume and runtime PM, though.

Thanks!
