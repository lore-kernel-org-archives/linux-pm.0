This assumes that those "subsystems" or rather "frameworks" (a bus type or
a device class is a subsystem in the terminology used throughout the PM
documentation) will (a) know about PM QoS and (b) will care to handle it.
Both (a) and (b) seem to be unrealistic IMHO.

We already export wakeup and runtime PM knobs per device via sysfs and
I'm not so sure why PM QoS is different in that respect.

Thanks,
