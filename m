Yes, but it is a policy decision the kernel should not force.
STD needs to work anyway.

OK, maybe I am dense, but if the key comes from user space, will that
be enough?

That would be an argument for compression in kernel space.
Not encrpting would always be faster.

Not if you want to keep the chain of trust intact. User space
is not signed.

Indeed.

Yes. But you are objecting to encryption in kernel space at all,
aren't you?
