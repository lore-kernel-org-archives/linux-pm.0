I guess Roger responded to that.

Why do you think thats a hack? Besides I don't know if you are
doing it right.

- I am agree with Tony in his discussion in

I don't think Tony said 'move all clock data into DT'. He was suggesting
a combination of DT and /lib/firmware

Well, you chose to look at highbank (which has 8 clock nodes in DT, as
opposed to OMAP5 which has around 250 in kernel) why don't you also look at imx?
drivers/clk/mxs/clk-imx28.c and Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/imx28-clock.txt
for examples.
They have around 65 nodes (still way lesser than OMAP) and see what
they do. Thats exactly what Roger does in his patch.
