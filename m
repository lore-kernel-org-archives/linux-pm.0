Another set of power supply properties could be added for that chip.
This way the get_property() function would be the same but actually the
POWER_SUPPLY_PROP_PRESENT won't be called for max77693.

Where the OTG FET feature is it enabled in your driver? I couldn't find
it.

Yes, I mentioned some of these differences (the Fast/top-off
differences). These are differences in values so it does not require new
driver. There is need to develop new driver just to support different
current (3.0 A instead of 2.1 A) or voltage threshold.

So the only new feature - battery presence - can be easily added to
existing driver. The driver can be extended for different
current/voltage values. Such extension may even be beneficial for new
Maxim MUIC/PMIC chipsets.


Best regards,
Krzysztof
