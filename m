I will try my best to convince you then. :-)

At the moment, system PM is already affecting behaviour of runtime PM
since it is preventing runtime suspend during system suspend.

To me and and those driver authors, that don't see the direct need for
why the PM core behaves like this (because we are not working with PCI
drivers for example), I would guess this is probably the piece in the
documentation we have more difficult to understand and adapt to.

I can point at some examples, were I believe drivers that use runtime
PM, tries to adapt to the PM core behaviour, but I fear they for too
many times have got it wrong. Here are some various examples I have
found, which made me think like this.

1.
Not many are using the .suspend_late callback at all, which should be
the most proper solution to use.

2.
Drivers are using the synchronise pm_runtime_put_sync in their
.suspend callbacks.

3.
Drivers do "pm_runtime_get_sync" from their .suspend callbacks, but
don't put the device into inactive state from anywhere as a part of
the system suspend.

4.
Drivers only handles system suspend tasks from it's .suspend callbacks
and don't implement .suspend_late, thus the device will not be fully
inactivated.

5.
Drivers relies on pm_runtime_suspended or worse
pm_runtime_status_suspend, to check if they shall put their device
into inactive state from their .suspend callbacks or leave it as is.
While they put the device into inactive state, the runtime state is
not properly updated to reflect this. Most important, at this point
runtime PM has not yet been disabled from the PM core.

I am not so happy with the naming myself, we should work out a better one then.

I should have stated, that I means those scenarios were the wakeup
configuration is decided in runtime and depending on the current
situation. For example depending on what kind of peripheral that is
connected. In this scenario, I think the advantage still stands.
