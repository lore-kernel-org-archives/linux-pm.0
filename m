Okay.  There's just a lot of weird stuff out there in ACPI-land.  I've
attached four minor fixes for the special cases that have been reported
(well, the last one is actually a fix for a typo in the spec, but just
the same...).

These should apply on top of linux-next; would you mind trying them out
to make sure I didn't break anything else on your laptop?  If they behave
as I hope they will, I think I'll have covered all the places where the
checking of MADT subtables needs to be be relaxed a bit.  These work for
me on arm64, but if they work for you and a couple of other testers, then
I'll send them to Rafael properly.

Many thanks!

Subject: [PATCH 1/4] ACPI: workaround x86 firmware using reserved MADT
 subtable IDs

According to the ACPI specification, version 6.0, table 5-46,  MADT
subtable IDs in the range of 0x10-0x7f are reserved for possible
future use by the specification.  The function bad_madt_entry() tries
to enforce the spec, but it turns out there are x86 machines that use
0x7f even though they should not.

So, continue to enforce this rule for arm64, since we're starting out
fresh, but relax it for systems already out there so we don't keep them
from booting.

Subject: [PATCH 2/4] ACPI: workaround x86 firmware with mis-matched FADT/MADT
 revisions

Looking across multiple versions of the ACPI specification, certain
versions introduce new revision numbers for the FADT and/or MADT
tables.  So, for example, an FADT indicating it is revision 4 should
not be paired with an MADT revision of anything less than 2.

However, there are systems out there that do not update the revision
fields in the FADT and MADT tables as they should.  So, for arm64, we
can be stricter in complying with the specification, but we need to
relax the checking for legacy systems.

Subject: [PATCH 3/4] ACPI: workaround FADT always being revision 2

In some environments, the FADT revision number is always 2, independent
of any other factors indicating that it may be a newer revision.  So,
we cannot rely on the FADT and MADT revisions being in proper step.  For
those environments, relax the checking so we only enforce the size check,
even if we do issue warnings on other problems.

If we do not relax the rules, these systems will not boot as they have in
the past.

Correct a typo where bad_madt_entry() expected the MADT GIC ITS subtable
to be 16 bytes long, but it is actually 20 bytes.  This is a cut'n'paste
error picked up from the spec and inadvertently replicated in code.
