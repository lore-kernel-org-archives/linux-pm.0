Sure, why not.

Ok.

If you mean having "struct device dev" instead of "struct device *dev", it has
also a drawback : all the legacy platforms have already a probing method, be
that platform data, device-tree or something else.

I'm a bit converned about the conversion toll. Maybe I've not understood your
point fully, so please feel free to explain, with an actual example even better.

This is because I've not begun to porting sound/pci/ac97_codec.c into
sound/ac97.

Ok.

Sure.

I'll try again, I seem to remember having tried that and it failed, but I can't
remember why.

Let me try again.

This creates :
/sys/bus/ac97/devices/pxa2xx-ac97\:0/ac97_controller

Of course as you pointed out, it's a 'ln -s .. parent' like link, but it seems
to me very unfriendly to have :
 - /sys/bus/ac97/devices/pxa2xx-ac97\:0/../ac97_operations
 - while /sys/bus/ac97/devices/ac97_operations doesn't exist (obviously)

Mmm, I don't know for this one, my mind is not set, it's a bit hard to tell if
it's only an unecessary link bringing "comfort", or something usefull.

A yes in the "goto err_unregister_device" case right, while it's necessary in
the "goto err_free_codec" case ... I need to rework that a bit.

That's because you suppose the initial scanning found all the ac97 codecs.
But that's an incomplete vision as a codec might be powered off at that time and
not seen by the first scanning, while the new scanning will discover it.

Right.

Ok.

A good catch, the ac97_controllers_mutex is missing.

Indeed.

Very true. And as all userspace interface, it needs to be discussed. If nobody
complains, I'll add the documentation for next patch round.

This is another "legacy drivers" issue.

The legacy driver (the one probed by platform_data or devicetree) doesn't
necessarily have a private structure to store this ac97_controller pointer. This
enables an "easier" porting of existing drivers.

Ah ... that will require a serious modification, and I see your point, so I'll
prepare this for next patchset.

Ok.

Ah yes, I'll remove it.
It's the future conversion of sound/pci/ac97_codec.c, but it's ... empty so far.

Thanks very much for the very detailed review.
