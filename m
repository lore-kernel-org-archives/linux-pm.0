I made a double check and  yes there are other components would like to
register their customized pm_power_off if _S5 is not available.
So if EFI reboot is not stable, current code may  not be robust enough .
Hum, how about this one?
(assigned to efi reboot only when there is no other components registered pm_power_off)
 return  acpi_gbl_reduced_hardware ||
	(acpi_no_s5 && ! pm_power_off);

I'm not sure, Windows might also leverage other drivers to achieve a poweroff.
