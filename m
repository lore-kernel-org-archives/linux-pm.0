That's a fine solution as far as I'm personally concerned.  I think
it's poor for Linux overall, because I think it's fragile, and it's
disappointing that a technology as important as Thunderbolt is so
poorly supported by the promulgators.  But if you're willing to work
in that environment, that's great.

You maintain the thunderbolt code and merge changes, and I'll review
the pieces that touch drivers/pci.  I do have a couple comments on
those pieces, but I don't think they'll be major.

I just want to get out of the business of merging drivers/thunderbolt
code that I can't maintain.
