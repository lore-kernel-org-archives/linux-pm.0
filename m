Well, I believe the idea of having them with their own io resource was to avoid
children drivers accessing each other io areas. Is this now working?

Why is this? I suppose the idea is to have the arch config selecting that flag.

Is this going to be reserved as well? if yes, how children are going to have
their own access functions?

fine, assuming the io split works...

this has some issue... I will post comment on the patch

Ohh.. Then what is the point of having them using their own io access functions,
nothing is again protected as you have only 1 io resource which is shared.
And now is even worse because you have several io access function..
I think this is moving backwards.

Based on the review comments on RFC patch series, there are more
things to be done.

I have the O4 and O5 zone definition ready. But that work depends
on generic CPU cooling patches. I have also looked the driver support
for 4430. But the probing and io resource split is still based on
previous design. I have also a patch which does the remapping in the
bandgap driver. But really, for this to work it would require to have
several entries in the reg property. And that is going to change from
BG version to BG version.

I can prepare some patches for this.
