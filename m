Just for clarification: does that mean that PM, PM_RUNTIME, and PM_SLEEP
are all synonyms now, or is there still some other combination that
allows a subset to be set?

Before we do lots of s/CONFIG_PM_SLEEP/CONFIG_PM/ changes in lots of
other drivers, it would be nice to come up with a new set of macros
to replace all the SET_RUNTIME_PM_OPS/SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS/..._OPS
with a version that avoided the #ifdefs altogether.
