All right I'll try this setup using round_down() then.

Although in this case we are handling 8-bit clumps, I anticipate device
drivers in the future which may benefit from larger size clumps (e.g.
GPIO devices with 24-bit ports). It'll be better to define clumps
similar to how we're defining bitmaps now (unsigned long *) so that we
can support these sizes if need be in the future without requiring data
type changes.

That's a good point. Originally, I had envisioned the possibility of
calling bitmap_get_value8/bitmap_set_value8 at odd start offsets; this
would open up the possibility of a clump landing as a split between 2
words, thus requiring this complicated case handling code. However, I'm
not sure how often users would need this case; none of the drivers right
now require clumps at odd offsets.

Andy, would you have any objection to restricting the start offset
values for bitmap_get_value8/bitmap_set_value8 to multiples of 8? That
would prevent the split word case, and thus allow the implementation for
those functions to be a lot simpler.
