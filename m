A batch-manager/job scheduler (such as loadleveler) must at times stop all 
tasks associated with a workload being run in a container. The workload may 
constitute of multiple tasks - some of which are in different sessions. 
A signal (STOP/CONT) to the Containers 'init' wont be transmitted to all 
the tasks in the Container. The 'freezer' mechanism allows this control
to be implemented in a clean way.
