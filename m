OK, that makes sense.

However, I don't know of anything in the PCI core that will notice
that the device has disappeared, so I doubt it will be removed from
the hierarchy.  I think that means the slot will become unusable until
a reboot, because the original device is gone and we can't add a new
one because the original one is still in the hierarchy.  That's not
very good, but it is better than a panic.

Yep.  So the panic Igor is seeing is probably an igb_resume() problem,
but after that's fixed, we'll probably trip over the PCI bug about not
handling the remove.
