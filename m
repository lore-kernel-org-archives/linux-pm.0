I thought you had suggested that I do this in your comments from v1, but 
I guess that was dependent on whether or not I put the properties I have 
inserted into the cpu node into the operating-points table instead. I 
still have gotten no comments from any DT maintainers so I left it as 
is. I am still not sure if that is acceptable.
