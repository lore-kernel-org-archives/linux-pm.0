Reasonable definition I think.  However the current implementation doesn't
exactly match it.
With the current implementation you risk losing wakeups *independent* of the
hardware properties.
Even with ideal hardware events can be lost - by which I mean that they will
not be seen until some other event effects a wake-up.
e.g. the interrupt which signals the event happens immediately before the
suspend is requested (or maybe at the same time as), but the process which
needs to handle the event doesn't get a chance to see it before the suspend
procedure freezes that process, and even if it did it would have no way to
abort the suspend.

So I submit that the current implementation doesn't match your description of
"forced", is therefore buggy, and that if it were fixed, that would be
sufficient to meet the immediate needs of android.
