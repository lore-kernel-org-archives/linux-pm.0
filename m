I fixed this by moving the lock so that it includes the update of the
next power state.

Speaking of the locking, currently a spinlock is used and it could be
replaced by a more efficient mutex. This is ok at the condition that
this code is not called from interrupt context?

Kevin,
Do you know if the per-device constraint code can be called from
interrupt context?
