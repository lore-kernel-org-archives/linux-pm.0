Sorry I found the NFS + Freezer is broken threads and probably should
have replied to myself.  We are now using SIGSTOP/SIGCONT with a brief
freeze to send the signals without race conditions.  With that said it
would be nice if these locking issues were eventually fixed because I
suspect it makes the freezer essentially useless for a large number of
enterprise users.
