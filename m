I could, but I do wonder if it is the right thing to do.

Shouldn't we fix platform_driver_probe() to support deferred probing.

As I understand it, it refused to retry a probe if there is an error, and t=
he
comments suggest that such retrying is avoided because it would be a waste
of time:

	/*
	 * Prevent driver from requesting probe deferral to avoid further
	 * futile probe attempts.
	 */

In this case, it isn't futile.

Earlier there is a comment saying:

 * Use this instead of platform_driver_register() when you know the device
 * is not hotpluggable and has already been registered, and you want to
 * remove its run-once probe() infrastructure from memory after the driver
 * has bound to the device.

I presume all this applies.  I assume that the only problem is a probe-order
thing.  So maybe we should fix platform_driver_probe() to do the right thing
with -EPROBEDEFER??

Trouble is, I really don't understand the  point or mechanism for
platform_driver_probe(), so I cannot suggest anything.
But I have been annoyed before that platform_driver_probe doesn't cope with
EPROBEDEFER, so I would like it fixed.
