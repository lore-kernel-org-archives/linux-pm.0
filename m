Hi Sinan,

I'm not sure I understand all your suggestions below.

Why would 'pci-wake' be a good name for this? We're doing basically the
same things that pci-acpi.c is doing (it also can configure the WAKE#
signal, via ACPI firmware calls).

Why is drivers/of/ special? I thought in general, the DT maintainers
preferred to move domain-specific stuff into the respective subsystems.

Also, the extraction is a very tiny piece of code, and the logic around
walking a PCI tree is the more important part. And in the
meantime...Jeffy has sent two more revisions of this patch set already,
and he did the latter (I like his abstraction of PCI device trees,
shared between ACPI and OF code) but not the former (it's still all
'pci-of.c').

Feel free to comment further on here or on v10, but at the moment I'm
not sure I understand yet how your suggestions would improve things.

Brian
