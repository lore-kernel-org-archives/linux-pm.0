I don't know why the current code treats bridges differently.

I see why you added a config option, because it clearly won't break
anything.  But I don't really like the config option because either
doing ASPM for bridges is supposed to work according to the spec, in
which case everybody should turn this on and enjoy the benefit, or it
isn't, in which case the parts in your system have non-standard
behavior, and we should use a quirk or similar approach.
