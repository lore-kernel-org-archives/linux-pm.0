Technically, I see no issue why this should not be possible. You see that with 
the SP800-108 KDF implementations where using CMAC is perfectly legal (and 
which I also test).

Though, using another keyed hash implementation like CMAC is not covered by 
the HKDF spec. If a caller would use hkdf(cmac(aes)), it would produce 
cryptographically strong values. Though this implementation does not conform 
to any standard. I do not think we should prevent a caller to select such 
combination in the kernel crypto API.

IMHO there would even be valid reasons why one would use cmac(aes) for a kdf. 
For example, when you would want to use a hardware AES which somehow also 
employs a hardware key that is inaccessible to software in order to tie the 
KDF result to the local hardware. This could even be a valid use case for Ext4 
FBE encryption where you derive a key. The KDF could be used to link the 
derived key to the local hardware to prevent the encrypted data could be 
copied to another system and decrypted successfully there.
