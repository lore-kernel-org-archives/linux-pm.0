Which I consider in the same range as the application which does:

      while (1);

  QoS(NONE) would be default policy for untrusted apps in the same way
  as you'd refuse the usage of supsend blockers for untrusted apps.
  
  while (1); is definitely not an application which should be granted
  trusted rights, right ?

  block_suspend(); while(1);
  
  is the same as:

  QoS(minimal latency); while(1);

  So if you really go to trust an "while (1);" application you better
  make sure that this app has the appropriate QoS(NONE) or QoS(10s)
  call in it before letting it lose.

  Numbers, yes. But I really give a sh*t about numbers w/o a detailed
  explanation of the scenario which created those numbers. And if the
  numbers boil down to: we handle the untrusted app which does "while
  (1);" then they are absolutely useless.

Why in the world should they lose wakeup events ? If an app goes idle,
it goes idle because it is waiting for an event. There is no other
sane reason except for those apps which are untrusted and force
idled. And for those you agreed already the suspend blockers don't
solve anything as they are either not implemented or the app is not
trusted to use them.

So we are back to round one of the whole discussion:

   Is it worth to create an utter mess in the kernel just to handle a
   subset of crappy coded applications ?

And the answer stays the same: No, not at all.

Thanks,
