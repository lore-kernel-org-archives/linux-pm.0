Sorry about this.  Wasn't aware that such a strange format was being
used.  The proposed patch looks good to me (formatting is a bit weird
though, the last "&dummy) == 3)) {" line shouldnt be needed if previous
line isn't indented so far.

Unless other more official init maintainer(s) want to pick this fix up:
since I committed the commit that caused this regression I can pick this
patch up and get it to Linus for 4.1-rc3 inclussion via linux-dm.git.
Please just let me know, thanks!
