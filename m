What kind of dependancy?  Runtime or build?  Where is the patch that
it depends on?  Is it in -next for in Mainline already?

If this patch has no build dependencies on patches which are in -next,
but not in Mainline then it will have to go in via the same tree that
the dependencies were applied to.  If the dependencies are already in
Mainline, or they are not build-deps, then it should go in via the
correct tree, which I believe is Sebastian's tree.

Either way you should do that.  Mark them as RESEND instead of PATCH
and apply all of the Acks you have accumulated so far.
