Dear Sebastian,


You already acked some earlier version of this patch. In that time
there were more dependencies on MFD tree. Now the MFD patch (2/5)
is acked by Lee Jones so could you pick up everything?


Changes since v4
================
1. Add patch 5/5: Update MAINTAINERS (with Sebastian's ack [2]).

Changes since v3
================
1. Patch 3/4: Don't create platform data structure for charger settings
   because driver won't be used on non-DT SoCs (its for Exynos based
   Trats2).
2. Patch 3/4: Drop Sebastian's ack [1] because of change above.

Changes since v2
================
1. Add ack from Sebastian Reichel (charger driver).
2. Drop patch "mfd: max77693: Map charger device to its own of_node"
   (applied by Lee Jones).


Changes since v1
================
1. Add patch 2/5: mfd: max77693: Map charger device to its own of_node
   (forgot to send it in v1)
2. Remove patches for DTS and configs. I'll send them later.
3. Add ack from Lee Jones (patch 3/5).


Description
===========
The patchset adds max77693 charger driver present on Trats2 board
(and Galaxy S III). The driver configures battery charger and exposes
power supply interface.

Driver is necessary to provide full charging stack on Trats2 device
(extcon, charger-manager etc.).
