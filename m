The patch only trusts the platform firmware to report D3cold correctly.
If it reports anything else the patch reads the PMCSR.

Thus if _PSC returns a bogus D0 status, worst that can happen is that we
incorrectly assume D3hot while the device is actually in D3cold.  Which
is still kind of a bummer.

We've got this handy pci_device_is_present() function which reads the
vendor ID and returns false if it's "all ones" (which is what we'd get
in D3cold).

What if we ask the platform firmware first.  If it says D3cold, assume
that's true.  In all other cases, call pci_device_is_present().  If
that returns false, assume D3cold.  Otherwise read the PMCSR.

That would also work for devices that are suspended to D3cold in a
nonstandard way, such as Thunderbolt.  Having a function that updates
the current_state in a robust way and correctly discerns D3cold and
D3hot would be really useful I think.

Thanks a lot for sharing these ACPI intricacies, it wasn't clear to me
in how far we can trust the platform firmware.

Best regards,

Lukas
