How does drivers/usb or drivers/net know the SMSC is used on beagle or
panda? Different power control approach is used in the two boards even
same SMSC chip is shipped in the two boards.

I only mean it is reasonable to put the power control code into board
file because
each board may take different power control approach even same SMSC chip
is used. I understand DT only describes the difference of the board via device
node, and I am not sure if the current DT is enough to convert the board file
into data as far as the problem is concerned.

parent device pointer may work on the panda problem, but may not work
on other case if one hardwired device is powered by another power domain.

So it is not a general solution on usb port power off.

As I explained above, it is reasonable to put the power control code in board
file, but current DT could convert these board file into device node?
