If we assume that user space speaks with a uniform voice on that
issue, it can just as well close the device. It seems to me that
declaring a device idle is a privileged operation.

Indeed. We can handle output to suspended devices by waking them.
I don't see why this case is different. We are talking about input
only.

Does that make sense in the generic framework at all? I still
think that drivers should cease IO for input in such cases.
That should involve a common callback, but no counter.
