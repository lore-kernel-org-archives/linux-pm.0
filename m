On the system, I observe the following:
[    2.114986] devices_kset: Moving 0004:00:00.0 to end of list
<---pcie port drive's probe, but it failed
[    2.115192] devices_kset: Moving 0004:01:00.0 to end of list

[   10.267081] devices_kset: Moving 0004:00:00.0 to end of list
 <---shpc_probe() on this bridge, failed too.

As you can the the parent device "0004:00:00.0" is moved twice, and
finally, it is after the "0004:03:00.0", this will break the
"parent<-child" order in devices_kset. This is caused by the code
really_probe()->devices_kset_move_last(). Apparently, it makes
assumption that child device's probing comes after its parent's. But
it does not stand up in the case.

As described, the bug is not related with device_reorder_to_tail(), it
is related with really_probe()->devices_kset_move_last(). So [2/4]
uses different method to achieve the "parent<-child" and
"supplier<-consumer" order. The [3/4] clean up some code in
device_reorder_to_tail(), since I need to revert the commit.

As described, it does not, just not be in use any longer.

Thanks and regards,
