If we don't have a use case, I don't think so...

We could generate a primary key and a keyedhash key that would be stored
outside kernel while data is at rest. Then during power on they could be
read to the kernel memory.

I did not consider who would create the files in the first place.

I neither did look at the code yet meaning that my comments should
definitely be taken with a grain of salt. Just writing down a remark.
