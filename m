Not sure if we are on the same page here, but what I meant is adding
the same explanation that is in your commit message to Device Tree
file as well so that if anyone looks at DT code and goes "Huh?" in the
future, they wouldn't have to research commit history to see the
reason why things the way they are.

I take it it's a no to my "any chance you can fix that as well?" ;-).
I'll see if I can find time to do that this week.

I used real i.MX7D Sabre board with i210 network card, when I was
porting i.MX7 PCIe patches. However, as per note I made in the
original submission:

https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/10/9/913

this IRQ swap patch came up as a result of "connecting" emulated ICH4
in QEMU which was using legacy interrupts.
