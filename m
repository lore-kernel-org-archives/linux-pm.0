For systems with runtime PM and deep idle states in cpuidle suspend is
already fairly opportunistic. If sleep states (including suspend to RAM
and CPU off) are factored in to cpuidle then it's very easy to get in to
situations where everything simply shuts off automatically, which can be
problematic if a platform doesn't expose any external wakeup sources.

Platforms still need to be able to establish some heuristics, whether
this is via blocking certain state transitions or simply defining a
maximum acceptable suspend depth irrespective of latency (at least we
presently don't have a clean interface for preventing entry in to
impossible to recover from idle states outside of latency hints via PM
QoS, or at least not one that I'm aware of).

On the other hand, while this isn't that difficult for the UP case it
does pose more problems for the SMP case. Presently the suspend paths
(suspend-to-RAM/hibernate/kexec jump) all deal with disabling and
enabling of non-boot CPUs via CPU hotplug explicitly, which will clear
them from the online CPU map. We would have to rework the semantics a bit
if cpuidle were also permitted to opportunistically offline CPUs.
