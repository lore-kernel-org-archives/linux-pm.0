I can't follow the gpio_matrix_driver example, but your point is
obviously true. 
A device should never register a constraint because of the data it
handles. That belongs into userspace. Or wherever the data is
consumed. 

I'm obviously not trying to say that a network driver should block
suspend while I'm on facebook. Or unblock when visiting m$.com. That
would be absurd. 

But, there are of course places in the kernel, where some kernel code
listens to data. For example the packet-filtering. Or sysrq-keys.
But I don't know how that relates to suspend_blockers now... ? 

Mind if I rephrase the quote?
From: "Well, it fits. The requirement is a direct consequence of the
intimate knowledge the driver has about the driven devices." 
To: "It fits, when the requirement is a direct consequence of the
intimate knowledge the driver has about the driven devices."

Cheers,

p.s.: tsss.... language... what a broken concept. And yet we have to
work with it.
