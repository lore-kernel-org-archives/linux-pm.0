Right, I see what you mean... strictly speaking histograms always do a
floor aggregation.

Right... that's the point.

We started with mapping to be able to track exact clamp values.
Then we switched to linear mapping to remove the complexity of
mapping, but we would like to still have the possibility to track
exact numbers whenever possible.

That's doable, otherwise maybe we can just add the above paragraphs to
the changelog of this patch. But give your comment above I assume you
prefer to split it out... just let me know otherwise.
