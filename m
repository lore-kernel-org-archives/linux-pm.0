So it seems that the Makefile changes in Linux next merge commit
e130bc1d00a4 cause changes with CONFIG_CC_STACKPROTECTOR_AUTO=y.
With next-20180112 out now, that's now commit  3823b7cc7a5e
("Merge branch 'akpm-current/current'"). Not sure if that's a
bug or not..

Anyways, I reran my "bisect boot wait-idle measure" test with
CONFIG_CC_STACKPROTECTOR_STRONG=y selected to rule out the AUTO
option, and bisect now points to a different commit that makes
more sense for my test case.

It's commit 3bb0f7c31b1a ("ASoC: don't use snd_soc_write/read
on twl4030"). And that is for the PMIC on my test system, so
adding Kuninori and Mark to the thread :)

Kuninori, it seems that commit 3bb0f7c31b1a causes higher
power consumption on an idle system on omap3 using twl4030.
Reverting 3bb0f7c31b1a makes things behave again. My guess
is that twl4030_read does not do the same as snd_soc_read
in the driver?

Regards,

Tony
