Fair enough. Let's agree on a non ambigous terminology then:

     forced:

	     suspend which you enforce via user interaction, which
     	     also implies that you risk losing wakeups depending on
     	     the hardware properties

     opportunistic:

	     suspend driven from the idle context, which guarantees to
	     not lose wakeups. Provided only when the hardware does
	     provide the necessary capabilities.

Thanks,
