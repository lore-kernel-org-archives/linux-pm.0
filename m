Viresh, are we ready with the cpufreq series?

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9122961/
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9122921/

Also current series: https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9123071/
Seems to have comments pending.

Dave is on vacation for another week or so, doubt he can respond in
