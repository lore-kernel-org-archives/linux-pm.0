From: Chen Yu <yu.c.chen@intel.com>

The PM core introduced the ability to keep devices runtime suspended
during the entire system sleep process with commit aae4518b3124
("PM / sleep: Mechanism to avoid resuming runtime-suspended devices
unnecessarily").

Drivers opt in to this so-called "direct_complete" mechanism by
returning a positive value from their ->prepare hook.  Usually this is
achieved with a "return 1;" statement, which looks somewhat cryptic to
readers not intimately familiar with the PM core.

Improve clarity by defining a DPM_DIRECT_COMPLETE constant which drivers
may use instead.
