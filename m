1. there is no other error code involved, before we try to convert the =
driver to handle EPROBE_DEFER.
So it is not that EPROBE_DEFER is special but that we add an error =
return path for it.

2. I don't know why it is not working - I just know that the handler =
seems to be triggered before
all resources are available (if probe() is aborted with EPROBE_DEFER =
error paths) which ends up in kernel panics.

Therefore just to be safe, I have reordered things a little (without =
changing the function):

1. check for resources (with some EPROBE_DEFER)
2. allocate non-devm (with optional EPROBE_DEFER)
3. allocate devm

So this should be safe in any case.

Well, it is not *me* doing that.

It is the unpatched driver which already does. See:

	=
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/dr=
ivers/power/supply/twl4030_charger.c?h=3Dv4.12-rc4#n1069

I have just moved this line to a different location to be able to add a =
proper EPROBE_DEFER return path.

Yes, this could be an alternative solution.
We still need EPROBE_DEFER handling.

Hm. No.

In upstream code it is never freed on probe failure because there is =
only
an error return (goto fail) after allocating irqs in case the
twl_i2c_write_u8 fails. Which usually doesn't.

The EPROBE_DEFER returned by iio_channel_get not being ready simply =
prints
a warning and turns off AC detection (bci->channel_vac =3D NULL) =
forever.

and this

+			    PTR_ERR(bci->transceiver) =3D=3D =
-EPROBE_DEFER) {
+				ret =3D -EPROBE_DEFER;	/* PHY not ready =
*/
+				goto fail;

This did run (and potentially return) after installing =
devm_request_threaded_irq leading
to observation of severe kernel panics by interrupts.

Moving the iio channel allocation before devm_request_threaded_irq made =
them go away.

How important is it to keep the current sequence of =
devm_request_threaded_irq() + (devm_)iio_channel_get() untouched?

The reason I ask is that it is more likely for (devm_)iio_channel_get() =
to fail than devm_request_threaded_irq().

Hence the iio channel should imho be always allocated first, so that we =
skip allocating+freeing unused irq handlers in case
of iio not being ready.

Therefore, I suggest to keep the proposed reordering even if we think =
devm-conversion of iio_channel_get() alone
would solve it equally well.

Next: should there be two separate patches? One for converting the =
non-devm iio_channel_get() and cleaning up error path.
And one for adding EPROBE_DEFER error path.

Or keep it in a single patch because they only make sense if done =
together (you can't add/remove deferred probing
without converting and/or moving iio_channel_get())?

So please advise how to proceed.

BR and thanks,
Nikolaus
