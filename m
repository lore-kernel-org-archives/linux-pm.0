Right in general.

Well, in the particular AMBA case fixing this should be quite straightforward.

Well, that's what happens today, except that driver runtime PM callbacks
are not directly invoked.  Actually, I tried to implement that, but it was
so ugly and fragile that I gave up.

It really is better if drivers point the different callback pointers to the
same rountine if they want to reuse it.

Right.
