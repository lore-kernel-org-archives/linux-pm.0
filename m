I already explained that we do not know the charging and discharging
current well enough for such a calculation.

And I explained that the =93internal resistance=94 is a system (battery=
 + cables +
connectors + other circuits) parameter that is not easy to derive or me=
asure
and type into the .dts source code.

At least I have no idea how I should find it out for my boards. While I=
 can
easily determine the curves (and we already have them for the platform_=
data
driver).

Please propose your own code doing that so that we can test if it is
better.

It is the diffference between 2% and 0% where a fuel indication might
be most important=85

The power controller will shut down - but the driver should report
reasonable (but IMHO not necessarily perfect) values until the last
moment.
