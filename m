The best example and actually the very specific problem we want to
solve is handling touchscreens on a phone / tablet. When the screen is
turned off, it is ideal to suspend the touchscreen for two reasons: to
lower the power consumption as much as possible and to prevent
interrupts to wake-up the CPU when the user touches the device, and
thus save even more power as we allow the CPU to stay in deep idle
states for longer periods.

Note that when the screen is turned-on again, we want to resume the
touchscreen so that it can send events again.

This is different then the lid closes examples, as in that case the
user can not generate new events and thus the usual autosuspend
feature is probably good enough (if the suspend power and autosuspend
power consumption is similar).
