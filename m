Sure we do have cases where the bootloader state needs to be
preserved for some devices. Like GPIO pin state to power memory on
some devices! :)

Well there's also the long term maintenance aspect at least I
need to consider.

If we downgrade it to a debug statement or a warning, we'll soon end
up with even more driver specific warnings than we already have.
And I don't want to be chasing people around to fix their drivers
for eavery new driver that gets submitted.

Also, without this error I would not even originally have noticed we
have a problem :) So I suggest the following:

1. I'll do a series of patches to fix up the handful of omap
   specific drivers with pm_runtime_use_autosuspend() that depend
   on omap_device

2. I'll also do a patch to improve the omap_device error message
   so new drivers are easy to fix. Something like:

  "%() called from invalid state %d, use pm_runtime_put_sync_suspend()?"

Does that sounds OK to you?

Regards,

Tony
