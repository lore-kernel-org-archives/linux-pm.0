No doubt the autosuspend delay is longer than the time it takes for a 
probe to fail.

I disagree.  The whole idea of autosuspend is to prevent the device's
power state from bouncing up and down too rapidly.  This implies that 
whenever the device gets resumed, we should wait at least the minimum 
autosuspend delay before allowing the next autosuspend.

Perhaps you think that it's silly to behave that way in this case,
because the device wasn't accessed at all during the time it was at
full power.  That's a valid objection, but the proper solution is not
to revert the 56f487c78015 commit.  Rather, change the driver to avoid
doing a pm_runtime_resume_sync until you _know_ that the device will be
accessed soon.
