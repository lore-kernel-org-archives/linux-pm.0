Yep, I don't think this is a very elegant way to do that, but until we
do have a generic DVFS layer, I'm not sure we have any other approach.
But maybe not.

The CPU is the real device, but AFAIK, nobody beside OMAP is
representing the CPU as the device.
But I'd rather use a CPU device than a fake CPUFREQ device.
