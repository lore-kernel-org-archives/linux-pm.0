Generically, there are three different issues with current OPP bindings:
a) ability to enable disable certain OPPs depending on SoC OTP/Efuse
settings.
b) ability to reuse OPPs defined for one device node for another (cpu1
to reuse OPP definitions of cpu0)
c) ability to add additional information per OPP. we can argue this is
a superset of (a), but really, the problems are different.

Previous proposals include making each OPP as a phandle, but there
does not seem much traction in that direction either. - proposal here
has nothing to do with (b) or (c).

Not just TI chips, but iMX, now, Marvell, Xilinx as well. potentially
more as well. doing OTP/Efuse based decision on which OPPs are valid
on a chip is not a TI specific thing. This was the reason for us to
try to define something generic enough to be reused by more SoCs than
just TI.

Errr.. adding platform code means the hardware description goes back
to kernel. is'nt that giving up on device tree binding for describing
hardware?

a) Trying to move the hardware definition away from device tree seems
to me a major step backwards.
b) Allowing for definitions in platform code is a step backwards again
for a generic solution that works for more than 1 vendor.
c) moving the logic away to bootloader when it can easily be done in
kernel again is adding burden to bootloader for data it does need to
handle.

OPP is a hardware behavior, which OPPs are enabled are described in
hardware on certain SoCs. the current proposal is to provide a generic
solution for those devices that allow for dynamic definition of OPPs
based on SoC efuse definition.
