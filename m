In the case of Thunderbolt on the Mac, runtime suspend means that the
controller is powered down. A plug event is side-band signaled using a GPE
so that we're able to power the controller up once something is plugged in.

It's not possible to power the controller down while devices are attached
because downstream devices have no way to side-band signal an interrupt
when they need to send data to the controller.

Alright, posted as v2 today. :-)

Thanks,
