I wasn't sure about that. If the device has pme_poll set, and the bridge
is in D3 (or anything else than D0) the it will not be scanned for PME
(this is done in pci_pme_list_scan()).

My understanding is that pme_poll is a workaround for bridges which do not
forward PME messages upstream properly. Since this whole thing is only
enabled for recent PCIe hardware, I would expect that this works also :)

The capability check in pci_pme_capable() means that we expect the
device to be capable of triggering PME from D3cold.

Because when you power down a bridge you cannot access config space of
the devices below that bridge anymore. It may also trigger the PCIe link
to go to L2 or L3.
