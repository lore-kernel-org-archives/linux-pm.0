I think it is kind of strange to give provision to userspace to
control a "request based" power management feature in the kernel. Me
personally can't think of any good use case, but I comes from the
embedded/ARM world so I might not have the full picture.

What would make sense to me, is to move the runtime PM sysfs to
debugfs, because it is a good feature to make use of during
development and debugging.

Hmm, this seems like a use case for runtime PM sysfs then. :-)

It sounds like vague arguments. If the driver has bugs we need to fix
them, right? Should we really let userspace workaround bugs in the
kernel?

Two minor functions will be added to the API, no big deal I think.
More importantly these will actually make life easier for some drivers
since they don't need to set up any additional PM callbacks.

Using the generic suspend_late approach would for sure work, but it
will spread to buses and power domains as well, which is not the case
when adding when adding a new API.

We have different view here. :-)

Whether I like it or not, the sysfs interface exist and then I think
the kernel must act accordingly. We shouldn=92t override it. I mean if
userspace has decided to keep a device active, there is probably a
reason.


Thanks a lot Alan for being patient with me and continuing the discussi=
on!

Kind regards
