I don't think that's platform-specific in general.  For example, there are
devices that don't really belong to any media-streaming-alike framework
and we may (and probably will) want to use PM QoS with them, because they
may be included in PM domains and influence power management of other
devices.  Think of a serial console.

If that's going to be per-device, it really is much easier to put it into
sysfs (we already have per-device PM debug interfaces in there).  It may
depend on CONFIG_PM_ADVANCED_DEBUG or something like this, though, at least
to start with.

There are ways to make people do right things. :-)

Anyway, if an interface is provided, people are free to use it and it
kind of is their problem if they do that for unreasonable things.  That
might be an issue for us if we were to remove that interface going forward,
but I'm not sure if that's going to ever happen.

The same applies to using kernel interfaces.  If someone uses a sane
interface for doing crazy stuff, that's their problem and should show
up as a red flag just as well.

Thanks,
