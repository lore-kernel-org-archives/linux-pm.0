we had an interesting debate on this topic on the the thread starting
http://marc.info/?l=linux-arm-kernel&m=128465710624421&w=2

It really does not provide any driver like feature here. it is just a 
bunch of helper functions which any SOC framework can use to build up to 
implement either:
a) cpufreq implementation with various OPPs
b) bootup in a specific opp in a set of supported OPPs and stay there 
(e.g. mpurate support on OMAP platforms)

I had considered putting it in drivers/power, but it looks to contain 
mostly regulator stuff, the other alternative would be to include it in 
kernel/power or as Kevin H, Linus W and you mention drivers/opp

Personally, I dont have a strong feeling about it as long as it is 
reusable across SOCs and am hoping to hear some alignment :).

Thanks. will incorporate this in v2 of my patchset.

there were a few OMAP followon patches from
http://marc.info/?l=linux-omap&m=128152135801634&w=2
which will actually use this for OMAP3 platform.

Locking:
arrgh.. my bad.. I had documented it in the missing and later on posted 
opp.txt http://marc.info/?l=linux-arm-kernel&m=128473931626114&w=2

The OPP layer implementation expects to be used in multiple contexts
(including calls from interrupt locked context) based on SOC framework 
implementation. It is recommended to use appropriate locking schemes 
within the SOC framework itself.

In terms of the lifetime rules on the nodes in the list:
The list is expected to be maintained once created, entries are expected 
to be added optimally and not expected to be destroyed, the choice of 
list implementation was for reducing the complexity of the code itself 
and not yet meant as a mechanism to dynamically add and delete nodes on 
the fly.. Essentially, it was intended for the SOC framework to ensure 
it plugs in the OPP entries optimally and not create a humungous list of 
all possible OPPs for all families of the vendor SOCs - even though it 
is possible to use the OPP layer so - it just wont be smart to do so 
considering list scan latencies on hot paths such as cpufreq transitions 
or idle transitions.

I should add comments to the effect of the same to the list header and 
documentation - will do this as part of v2.

Ack. thanks for catching this. Will do it in v2.

ack. thanks.. yes it does clean it up. additionally i expanded  the 
static opp_populate which is used just once - removed one function call ;)

explained above. it is the job of the framework using the OPP Layer library.

Thanks and ouch.. Again missing documentation. Apologies.
http://marc.info/?l=linux-arm-kernel&m=128473931626114&w=2
c) Dependency of OPP layer is on CONFIG_PM as certain SOCs such as Texas
Instrument's OMAP support have frameworks to optionally boot at a 
certain opp without needing cpufreq.

This is called "mpurate" bootarg parameter in OMAP framework. I will put 
this under #ifdef CPUFREQ and provide header coverage for the same 
appropriately.
