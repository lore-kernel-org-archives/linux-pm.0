From: Rafael J. Wysocki <rafael.j.wysocki@intel.com>

Make the PM core avoid invoking the "late" and "noirq" system-wide
suspend (or analogous) callbacks for devices that are in runtime
suspend during the corresponding phases of system-wide suspend
(or analogous) transitions.

The underlying observation is that runtime PM is disabled for
devices during those system-wide suspend phases, so their runtime
PM status should not change going forward and if it has not changed
so far, their state should be compatible with the target system
sleep state.

This change really makes it possible for, say, platform device
drivers to re-use runtime PM suspend and resume callbacks by
pointing ->suspend_late and ->resume_early, respectively (and
possibly the analogous hibernation-related callback pointers too),
to them without adding any extra "is the device already suspended?"
type of checks to the callback routines, as long as they will be
invoked directly by the core.

 During system-wide resume from a sleep state it's easiest to put devices into
 the full-power state, as explained in :file:`Documentation/power/runtime_pm.txt`.
