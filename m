No, you're not I think, the above is correct.  I was referring to the scenario
in which the device was RPM_SUSPENDED initially.

Well, given that this discussion is taking place at all, I admit that it would
be good to document this somehow. :-)

I'll take care of that.

First of all, the device can always be resumed regardless of the usage_count
value.  usage_count is only used to block attempts to suspend the device and
execute its driver's ->runtime_idle() callback after it has been resumed.
That's why the "normal" pm_runtime_get() queues up a resume request.

IOW, the _get() only becomes meaningful after attempting to resume the device
(which is what I tried to tell Arjan in one of the previous messages).

Second, there's no synchronization between pm_runtime_get_noresume() and
pm_runtime_suspend/idle() etc., so calling pm_runtime_get_noresume() is
certainly insufficient to block pm_runtime_suspend/idle() regardless of memory
barriers (there may be one already in progress when _get_noresume() is called).
To limit possible status changes from happening one should (at least) run
pm_runtime_barrier() (surprise, no? ;-)) after pm_runtime_get_noresume().

So if you don't want to resume the device immediately after increasing its
usage_count (in which case it's better to use pm_runtime_get_sync()), you
should do something like this:

1) pm_runtime_get_noresume(dev);
1a) pm_runtime_barrier(dev);  // That takes care of all pending requests etc.

2) ...
 
3) pm_runtime_put_noidle(dev);

[The meaning of pm_runtime_barrier() is that all of the runtime PM activity
started before the barrier has been completed when it returns.]

There's one place in the PM core where that really is necessary, but I wouldn't
recommend anyone doing anything like it in a driver.

Thanks,
Rafael
