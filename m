I'm not sure I understand what you're saying.  Are you suggesting that
this "inhibit" mechanism should involve a new callback different from
the existing runtime-PM callbacks?  And when this new callback is
invoked, drivers should cancel existing input requests (these devices
are input-only) and go to low power?

This would create a parallel runtime-PM mechanism which is independent
of the existing one.  Is that really a good idea?
