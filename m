It doesn't have to do that.

The problem here is that pci_pm_thaw_noirq() calls pci_restore_state() which
in fact requires the device to be in D0, so the caller should put it into
D0 instead of trying to "update" its power state.

[Note that the PCI layer doesn't put devices into low-power states during the
hibernation's "freeze" transition, but drivers can legitimately do that in
their "freeze" callbacks which was overlooked in that code and that's what
i915 does.]

So IMO what we need is the change below.  I'm going to test it shortly,
but please give it a go too.
