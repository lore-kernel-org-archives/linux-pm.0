Yes, I have no issue with this and will move the ti properties into the 
operating points table for v3 of the series.

The operating-points-v2 binding here [1] was designed with doing this in 
mind, and others are using it and the corresponding functionality 
offered by the OPP core to selectively enable OPPs. Why hide this in 
u-boot when we already have kernel framework support to do it?

Thanks for your comments, will send v3 moving the appropriate properties 
into the OPP table.
