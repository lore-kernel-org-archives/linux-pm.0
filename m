Right.

Basically, that would need a list (or equivalent) of devices sharing
the wakeup IRQ and if that triggers, it needs to walk the list and
call pci_pme_wakeup() for all devices in it.

I think that the binding needs to be sort-of PCI-specific to cover the
shared case.

I'm not sure if there are any other buses needing that (they would
need to define standard PM registers as PCI does).
