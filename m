Actually SCM registers window is mapped statically. Mapping is defined in omap44xx_io_desc[] in arch/arm/mach-omap2/io.c:

...
        .virtual    = L4_44XX_VIRT,
        .pfn        = __phys_to_pfn(L4_44XX_PHYS),
        .length        = L4_44XX_SIZE,
        .type        = MT_DEVICE,
...


So ioremap() always returns same virtual address (0xfc002000).
