Changes in v13:
  - Reimplement find_next_clump8 to leverage find_next_bit
  - Restrict bitmap_get_value8/bitmap_set_value8 start argument to
    values that are multiples of 8; this prevents cases where a clump
    lands between word boundaries
  - Trim const qualifiers from bitmap_get_value8, bitmap_set_value8, and
    find_next_clump8; this should help improve readability of the code
  - Redefine parameter list for bitmap_get_value8, bitmap_set_value8,
    and find_next_clump8 to use unsigned long in order to match the
    find_next_bit data types and naming conventions

While adding GPIO get_multiple/set_multiple callback support for various
drivers, I noticed a pattern of looping manifesting that would be useful
standardized as a macro.

This patchset introduces the for_each_set_clump8 macro and utilizes it
in several GPIO drivers. The for_each_set_clump macro8 facilitates a
for-loop syntax that iterates over a memory region entire groups of set
bits at a time.

For example, suppose you would like to iterate over a 32-bit integer 8
bits at a time, skipping over 8-bit groups with no set bit, where
XXXXXXXX represents the current 8-bit group:

    Example:        10111110 00000000 11111111 00110011
    First loop:     10111110 00000000 11111111 XXXXXXXX
    Second loop:    10111110 00000000 XXXXXXXX 00110011
    Third loop:     XXXXXXXX 00000000 11111111 00110011

Each iteration of the loop returns the next 8-bit group that has at
least one set bit.

The for_each_set_clump8 macro has four parameters:

    * start: set to the bit offset of the current clump
    * clump: set to the current clump value
    * bits: bitmap to search within
    * size: bitmap size in number of bits

In this version of the patchset, the for_each_set_clump macro has been
reimplemented and simplified based on the suggestions provided by Rasmus
Villemoes and Andy Shevchenko in the version 4 submission.

In particular, the function of the for_each_set_clump macro has been
restricted to handle only 8-bit clumps; the drivers that use the
for_each_set_clump macro only handle 8-bit ports so a generic
for_each_set_clump implementation is not necessary. Thus, a solution for
large clumps (i.e. those larger than the width of a bitmap word) can be
postponed until a driver appears that actually requires such a generic
for_each_set_clump implementation.

For what it's worth, a semi-generic for_each_set_clump (i.e. for clumps
smaller than the width of a bitmap word) can be implemented by simply
replacing the hardcoded '8' and '0xFF' instances with respective
variables. I have not yet had a need for such an implementation, and
since it falls short of a true generic for_each_set_clump function, I
have decided to forgo such an implementation for now.

In addition, the bitmap_get_value8 and bitmap_set_value8 functions are
introduced to get and set 8-bit values respectively. Their use is based
on the behavior suggested in the patchset version 4 review.
