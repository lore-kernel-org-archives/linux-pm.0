Sorry, my E-mail was unclear.  Here is my intended point:

The current Android opportunistic suspend governor does not enter full=20
system suspend until all suspend-blocks are released.  If the governor=20
were modified to respect the scheduler, then it could enter suspend the=20
moment that the system had no further work to do.

So during part of the (HZ / 2) time interval in the above code, the system=
=20
is running some kernel or userspace code.  But after that work is done, an=
=20
idle-loop-based opportunistic suspend governor could enter idle during=20
the remaining portion of that (HZ / 2) time interval, while the current=20
governor must keep the system out of suspend.

Of course, to do this, a different method for freezing processes would be=
=20
needed; one possible approach is described here[1]; others have proposed=20
similar approaches.


regards,
