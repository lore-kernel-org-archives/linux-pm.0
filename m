Yeah, and that is what I really meant. Sorry for the confusion. The exec
is problematic in his scenario too, given he is running on a very
interesting NFS setup. Yes, the WAIT_EXEC is set:
392 static int run_cmd(const char *cmd)
393 {
394         char **argv;
395         static char *envp[] =3D {
396                 "HOME=3D/",
397                 "PATH=3D/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin",
398                 NULL
399         };
400         int ret;
401         argv =3D argv_split(GFP_KERNEL, cmd, NULL);
402         if (argv) {
403                 ret =3D call_usermodehelper(argv[0], argv, envp, UMH_WA=
IT_EXEC);
404                 argv_free(argv);
405         } else {
406                 ret =3D -ENOMEM;
407         }
408=20
409         return ret;
410 }
411=20
