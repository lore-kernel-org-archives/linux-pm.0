I'll think about this a bit more, but really I don't care for vgaswitcheroo
manual power control anymore. It's in debugfs for a reason, it was a stopgap
until we got dynamic power control.

If dynamic power control isn't working for some people we should fix that,
but supporting nouveau.runpm=0 and manual power control is so far down
the list of things I care about.

Dave.
