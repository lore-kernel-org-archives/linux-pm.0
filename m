The functionality is part of the "PON" block in the Qualcomm PMICs,
other functionality from this block relates to configuration and
handling related to power-key and reset-key.

Several of these properties are intermingled, so I do believe it's best
to handle them in a single driver; that said, it might no longer be
correct to name the driver "pwrkey" or that it is a "misc input" driver.
