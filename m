Resending the original series (except for the first patch that has been
applied already) along with some driver code changes based on them as
requested by Ulf.

The driver patches are an intel-lpss change (already reviewed), two
modifications of i2c-designware-platdrv (posted previously but slightly
changed since then) and a PCIe port driver change.

At this point patches [1-3/7] are pretty much on the way in and the driver
material depends on review comments (it is pointless to apply [4/7] without
[5-6/7], so it depends on them in my view).

I'm sending this from a system running with all of the series applied, although
admittedly not using i2c-designware-platdrv.  However, one of my test machines
has this one and I haven't seen any adverse effects of these changes on it so
far.

Thanks,
Rafael
