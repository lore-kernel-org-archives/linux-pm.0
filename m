It won't work currently for multiple devices but adding more than
one wakeriq per device is doable. And I think we will have other
cases where multiple wakeirqs are connected to a single device, so
that issue should be sorted out sooner or later.

And if requesting wakeirq for the PCI WAKE# lines at the PCI
controller does the job, then maybe that's all we need to start with.

Then in addition to that, we could do the following to allow
PCI devices to request the wakeirq from the PCI controller:

1. PCI controller or framework implements a chained irq for
   the WAKE# lines assuming it can mask/unmask the WAKE# lines

2. PCI devices then can just request the wakeirq from the PCI
   controller

And that's about it. Optionally we could leave out the dependency
to having PCI devices implement PM runtime and just resume the
parent (PCI controller) if PCI devices has not implemented
PM runtime.

Hmm sounds racy, need to take a look. I think the only reason
to have the wakeirq pointer there was to save memory. It might
make sense to remove the wakeirq dependency here.
