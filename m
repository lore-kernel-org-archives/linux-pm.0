OK, I'm not generally familiar with these things, so a couple of questions.

Does it mean that the full set of possible OPPs is already known from the
hardware configuration and the ones that are actually useable are found
during boot?

What does IP stand for in this context?

How does the kernel learn about these things?  Do they need to be hardcoded
or is there any dynamic configuration mechanism available?

Can you please describe these data structures in a bit more detail?

I noticed that in a few places it isn't really necessary to return a pointer.
I think you can simply return int in such cases.

What do they do exactly?

How exactly is that supposed to work?

OK, suppose I'm writing a driver that needs to care.  What should I use these
functions for?

The data structures require some more description IMHO.  They aren't completely
intuitive.
