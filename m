I tried 150 ms and it didn't work. The pm_runtime_mark_last_busy()
is needed no matter how much you increase the autosuspend delay.
This isn't hackish. :-) The issue is that pm_runtime_mark_last_busy()
has never been called so far, so dev->power.last_busy == 0.
The PM core thinks that the device can suspend right away because it's
last been busy more than 2 seconds ago.

One could argue though if pm_runtime_mark_last_busy() should come
before pm_runtime_put_autosuspend(). Usually it should, but in this
case it doesn't matter because pm_runtime_allow() hasn't been called
yet and the PCI core initializes devices to pm_runtime_forbid().
