I totally agree! You are touching the part of the PM code for SDIO
that is severely broken in my view.

The mmc core shouldn't mess with runtime PM for func device at all,
except setting up the parent-child relationship. Instead runtime PM
for the func device should be solely handled by the func driver.

This seems like a different issue. I guess this is because the func
driver don't implement the PM callbacks, which makes the mmc core to
remove the sdio card at mmc_pm_notify().

The proper solution here is to make the sdio func driver to implement
the PM callbacks.

Overall this looks okay to me. Except for the changelog that is a bit
miss-leading.

Kind regards
