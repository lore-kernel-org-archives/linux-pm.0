When the pages get copied to their final resting place the dirty bits
of the corresponding physical pages get set automatically by the
hardware.
If there would be some code that would clear the dirty bit after the
copy operation then we would have some underindication and as a result
the possibility of data corruption, but we've never seen this.
However since s390 is the only architecture which has dirty bits for
physical pages I doubt that there is any such code present. So the
bug should happen independently of image compression.

What is missing is code that restores the original storage keys after
the pages have been copied to their final place.
I need to read the suspend/resume code and figure out how to fix this.
