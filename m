The operatings-points-v2 table for am4372 was merged before any user of
it was present in the kernel and before the binding had been finalized.
The new ti-cpufreq driver and binding expects the platform specific
properties to be part of the operating-points-v2 table rather than the
cpu node so let's move them there as the only user is the ti-cpufreq
driver.
