This reverts commit c36e6ec904876de1935b1d74d2d711e6f5ceb572.

The original commit updated the cpufreq operating points tables for
am335x-boneblack but was merged before the driver making use of the node
was merged, which breaks the existing cpufreq implementation on the
system, so revert the patch until the ti-cpufreq driver is merged.
