Hmm sorry yes I'm confused again. Yeah it looks like calling rpm_idle
just has a side effect that makes a difference here.

I guess I need to add more printks to figure out what's going on here.
But yeah, I'm not seeing the callback happening at the interconnect
level so hardware and PM runtime states won't match on the following
probe after -EPROBE_DEFER.

I guess you mean pm_runtime_set_suspended() above? I'm seeing a state
where we now set pm_runtime_set_suspended() between failed device
probes and the device is still active in hardware.

The patch below also helps with the problem and leaves out the
rpm_suspend() call from loop so it might give more hints.

The difference here from what Rafael suggested earlier is calling
__pm_runtime_use_autosuspend() and then not calling
pm_runtime_set_suspended().

However, it seems the below patch keeps hardware active in the
autoidle case though, so chances are there is more that needs to
be done here. Anyways, I'll try to debug it more tomorrow.

Regards,

Tony
