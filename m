you can always increase powertop's interval through command line and
once you went down to 1 wakeup every two seconds, you increase
powertop's interval and try to cut down 10 more ill-behaved apps. And
you keep going until you have e.g. 1 wakeup per minute or whatever your
target is.

Agree with you here.

if that's the only thing we want suspend_blockers for, there are other
simpler ways to do it. Just add a kernel debugging option for anyone
doing poll() or keeping a device open() or whatever and you have the
name the of the processes consuming power and preventing system from
going into sleep.

IMO, suspend_blocker is trying to fix application problems in kernel
space by unconditionaly (well sort of) freezing userspace if there are
no suspen_blockers held. So even if application is doing
poll(pfds, ARRAY_SIZE(pfds), 2); that won't be noticed because as long as
the suspend_blocker is released, that poll() will be frozen, no ?

IMO the real fix would be on that particular poll(), changing the
timeout e.g. based on cpufreq notifications or even relying completely
on IRQs with poll(pdfs, ARRAY_SIZE(pfds), -1); Of course, this is only a
crude example trying to show that the real issue lies on the application
rather than on kernel.
