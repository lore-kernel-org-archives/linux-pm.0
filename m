Hi,

Please keep it for now.  You can rename it later if there's a clear
benefit, but I'm not sure still.

Well, I don't like this change.

In fact, I'd prefer it if the old interface were kept unmodified.

The idea is right in general, but so to speak it didn't work out too well.

The most important change is the introduction of struct pm_qos_constraints,
which doesn't need any preparation IMO.  I'd do this possibly early in the
series and I'd do it like this:

+struct pm_qos_constraints {
+       struct plist_head list;
+       s32 target_value;
+       s32 default_value;
+       struct blocking_notifier_head *notifiers;
+};

(more on the notifiers later).  Please note the lack of the type field.

At the same time I'd redefine struct pm_qos_object in the following way:

 struct pm_qos_object {
-       struct plist_head requests;
+       struct pm_qos_constraints *constraints;
-       struct blocking_notifier_head *notifiers;
        struct miscdevice pm_qos_power_miscdev;
        char *name;
-       s32 target_value;       /* Do not change to 64 bit */
-       s32 default_value;
        enum pm_qos_type type;
 };

so for the _existing_ PM QoS classes you can simply use
constraints->list instead of requests, constraints->target_value
instead of target_value, constraints->defaul_value instead of default_value
and constraints->notifiers instead of notifiers.

I wouldn't introduce a "global" PM QoS class for devices.

That should be a relatively simple patch that doesn't change the
existing interface and functionality.

The next patch would be to modify update_target() so that it takes
a pointer to struct pm_qos_constraints instead of the pointers to
struct pm_qos_object and struct plist_node (possibly also to take
an "operation" argument instead of the "del" one).  All it needs is
in struct pm_qos_constraints, so that should be simple too.
The modified update_target() should return a value indicating
whether or not prev_value was different from curr_value, so that
the device PM QoS functions (introduced by the next patch) can use it
to trigger system-wide notifications.

The next patch would introduce the per-device PM QoS by (1) adding
a struct pm_qos_constraints _pointer_ to struct dev_pm_info (assuming
that at least _some_ devices won't use PM QoS) and (2) adding
dev_pm_qos_add/update/remove_request() in drivers/base/power/qos.c,
all of them using the modified update_target().

Now if system-wide notifier chain for devices is necessary, you can
simply define it as a static variable in drivers/base/power/qos.c
without actually adding any "PM QoS object" for this purpose.  Now,
you can use the value returned by the modified update_target() to
decide whether or not to run notifiers from dev_pm_qos_*_request().

Does it make sense to you?
