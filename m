Yes, that seems to be one of problems of Yu Chen's patchset.

I don't particulary love the idea of doing hibernation encryption in
the kernel, correct.

But we have this weird thing called secure boot, some people seem to
want. So we may need some crypto in the kernel -- but I'd like
something that works with uswsusp, too. Plus, it is mandatory that
patch explains what security guarantees they want to provide against
what kinds of attacks...

Lee, Chun-Yi's patch seemed more promising.				Pavel
