Correct.

If populated, the PM domain callbacks should call the driver callbacks.
If there are no PM domain callbacks, then the subsystem (in this case,
the platform_bus) should be calling the driver callbacks.

Yup, there's a bug.    They're not missing, just misplaced. ;)

When adding the noirq callbacks to ensure devices are idled late in
suspend by omap_device, I the patch commited mistakenly uses
SET_SYSTEM_SLEEP_PM_OPS(), which sets the "normal" suspend/resume
handlers and not the noirq handlers.

Can you try the patch below?  I only briefly tested it on omap3/n900 so
far.

This populates most of the PM domain methods with the same ones used by
the subystem (platform_bus) and only overrides the noirq methods with
custom versions.  This patch should make all the driver's suspend/resume
methods be called as expected.

After a bit more sanitiy testing, I'll post a real patch for the -rc
series.
