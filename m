Perhaps set after callbacks are made. But given that the approach 
doesn't work anyway...

It's still racy. Going back to my example without any of the suspend 
blocking code, but using a network socket rather than an input device:

int input = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM|SOCK_NONBLOCK, 0);
char foo;
struct sockaddr addr;
connect (input, &addr, sizeof(addr))
while (1) {
       if (read(input, &foo, 1) > 0) {
               (do something)
       } else {
               (draw bouncing cows and clouds and tractor beams briefly)
       }
}

A network packet arrives while we're drawing. Before we finish drawing, 
the policy timeout expires and the screen turns off. The app's drawing 
is blocked and so never gets to the point of reading the socket. The 
wakeup event has been lost.
