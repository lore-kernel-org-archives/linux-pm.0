Yes.

get confused that Wilmer can not use 3.10 stable kernel.

BIOS set power state correctly, so first suspend/resume will work.

late because setting power state will rely on the enable-cnt, first resume would
not set the power state related correctly, then second suspend/resume will not
work anymore.

will check if we can change to:
check hw status, and then enable the pci device on boot path instead.
