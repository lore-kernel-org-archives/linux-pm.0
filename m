Would you like to come and watch my laptop resume ? With printk's if you
want. You appear at this point to be arguing that bumble bees can't
fly, while watching one.

IFF its your bogus example
IFF you don't have any task waiting for resume notifications (ie its not
X)

So take the PC desktop case and for simplicity sake lets assume the X
application in question has either filled the socket (unlikely) or is mid
query request so blocked on the socket.

The important line then is

'The kernel lets interested people know a resume occurred'

Interesting people includes X
X therefore ends up on the runqueue
X gets the display back in order
X completes processing the outstanding X request and replies
The application continues

If I was blocked on say serial output then the resume is going to wake
the serial driver, which will transmit the queue, which will wake the app.
