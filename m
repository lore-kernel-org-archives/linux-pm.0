This issue because of which 52cdbdd49853 (driver core: correct device's
shutdown order) was added is not present from 4.18, since dra7 started using
sdhci-omap.c driver which doesn't disable regulator during shutdown. (The
original issue was present in omap_hsmmc driver).

When sdhci-omap driver is modified to disable regulator during shutdown,
something like device_link_add() can be added in _regulator_get().

Since this doesn't reintroduce the problem that was solved by 52cdbdd49853,
this can be safely merged.
