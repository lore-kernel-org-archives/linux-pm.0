It is not generally safe and there are multiple factors deciding of it
(see the message I've just sent for details).

Well, it's just that multiple things go into play here: the subsystem, the
overall complexity of the driver and so on.  I can probably say what's
good for a PCI driver, but that may not be suitable for a USB driver, for
one example.
