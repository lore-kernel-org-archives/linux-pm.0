The other case I had in mind is specific to the PCI layer and might be better
served by adding an "ignore PME" flag to PCI devices.

If we do that, can it still be regarded as a PM attribute?

And what about the corresponding callback?  Should that be a PM callback or
a general one?

That sounds like a general rather than PM-related mechanism then.

I guess we need a real use case for that last thing or it will be rather
difficult to convince Greg to accept the patch. :-)
