It is not direct, but Section 16.1.6 of ACPI 6.2 says this in step 4
of the system suspend outline:

OSPM places all device drivers into their respective Dx state. If the
device is enabled for wake,
it enters the Dx state associated with the wake capability. If the
device is not enabled to wake
the system, it enters the D3 state.
