Exactly, and that's what applications in the N900 do. For this to work
reliably, you need these notifications (network disconnected, screen
off) to be easily accessible, and even transparent to the application
writer.

I don't think the suspend blockers solve much. A bad application will
behave bad on any system. Suppose somebody decides to port Firefox to
Android, and forgets to listen to the screen off event (bad on Android
or Maemo), however, notices the application behaves very badly, so by
googling finds these suspend blockers, and enables them all the time
the application runs.

When the user install the application, will be greeted by a warning
"This application might break PM, do you want to enable suspend
blockers?" (or whatever), as any typical user would do, will press Yes
(whatever).

We end up in exactly the same situation.
