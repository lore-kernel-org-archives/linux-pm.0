Of course.

What user? User that inhibited it or user that tried to use the device?

I think we should treat in-kernel users as all other users.

Or maybe IIO device. Or hwmon. Or something else. I think if we allow
drivers (or subsystems) to opt in into this mechanism it will solve much
of worries about disks and similar devices that indeed not very suitable
for such mechanism.
