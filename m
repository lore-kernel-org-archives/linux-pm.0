This would be a struct device that is not bound to a driver, but just acts
as a shell for the controller and places it inside the device hierarchy. You
get reference counting and other management functions as well as a
consistent naming scheme. E.g. you can call the devices ac97c%d (or
something similar) and then call the CODEC ac97c%d.%d.

This is how most frameworks implementing some kind of control bus are
structured in the Linux kernel. E.g. take a look at I2C or SPI.

Your controller driver itself is unaffected by this, you still call
snd_ac97_controller_register() from the probe function and so on.

Ok, makes sense. But maybe just leave them out for now and add them when
they are used.

It is additional ABI and we do not have this for any other bus either (e.g.
you don't see a backlink for a I2C or SPI device to the parent). In my
opinion for the sake of keeping things consistent and simple we should not
add this.

It should use put_device() in both cases, check the the device_register()
documentation. It says that put_device() must be used, even if
device_register() fails.

But why would the device become suddenly visible when the driver is
registered. This seems to be an as arbitrary point in time as any other.

Also consider that when you build a driver as a module, the module will
typically only be auto-loaded after the device has been detected, based on
the device ID. On the other hand, if the driver is built-in driver
registration will happen either before or shortly after the controller
registration.

If there is the expectation that the AC97 CODEC might randomly appear on the
bus, the core should periodically scan the bus.

I might be missing something, but I'm not convinced by this. Can you point
me to such a legacy driver where you think this would not work?
