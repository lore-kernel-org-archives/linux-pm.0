This needs an ack from Rafael.

Naive question: why is the default target_state PCI_D3hot?

This only covers the case of !device_may_wakeup().  So I guess
device_may_wakeup() is false for these Thunderbolt controllers.  Is
there a reason you don't want to do this check for devices that may
wakeup?

Sorry, more naive questions.  I don't know anything about power
management, and it all looks like black magic to me.
