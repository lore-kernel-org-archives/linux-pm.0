Being the first clock is only required for the "NULL" clock. And that
is only done
for legacy shmobile kernels, not for multi-platform.

In this patch series, the clock would be chosen based on the presence of the
CLK_RUNTIME_PM flag, to be set by the clock driver. I.e. DT is not involved
directly (for a change... why does everybody think the whole world revolves
 around DT these days ? :-)

Empty names should not be used if there can be multiple clocks, right?

Grepping in arch/*/boot/dts/, "fck" seems to be popular (only) for TI SoCs.

Stadardizing across SoCs and architectures would be nice, though.
