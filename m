Violently agreed.

And really, the only semi-technical argument against the opportunistic suspend
feature I've seen so far in this thread is that it _may_ _be_ possible to
achieve the same goal in a different way.  If I don't see anything more serious
than that, I will take the patchset and push it to Linus (patches [1-6/8] from
version 7 to be precise, as soon as the changelogs are improved as
requested).

Thanks,
Rafael
