I overlooked that, thanks for pointing it out.

Well, assuming that https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/893722/ is applied,
which is going to be, I think we can put

+       pm_runtime_get_noresume(dev);
+       pm_runtime_enable(dev);

in device_resume() after the dev->power.is_suspended check and
pm_runtime_put_noidle() under the End label.  That cause them to
be called under the device lock, but that shouldn't be a big deal.

Accordingly, we can call pm_runtime_disable(dev) in __device_suspend(),
right next to the setting of power.is_suspended.

This is implemented by the patch below.

Thanks,
Rafael
