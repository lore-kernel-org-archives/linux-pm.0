The advantages for using the kernel crypto API to add KDFs as opposed to=20
adding helper wrappers are the following in my view:

=2D employment of the kernel crypto API testmgr - invocation of the testmgr=
 is=20
transparent and thus already provided without any additional code to link t=
o=20
it

=2D FIPS 140-2 compliance: To mark a KDF as FIPS 140-2 approved cipher, it =
must=20
be subject to a known-answer self test (implemented by the testmgr) as well=
 as=20
to an enforcement of the integrity check verification. In FIPS 140-2 mode, =
the=20
kernel crypto API panic()s when a kernel crypto API module is loaded and it=
s=20
signature does not check out. As this is only relevant for crypto modules (=
and=20
not arbitrary other kernel modules), this is implemented with the invocatio=
ns=20
the crypto_register_alg as well as crypto_register_template functions. Thus=
,=20
when using a wrapper code to implement the KDF, they can per definition not=
 be=20
=46IPS 140-2 approved.

=2D The invoker of a KDF has one consistent API. This implies that the KDF=
=20
selection now becomes more of a "configuration" choice. For example, when y=
ou=20
look at the KDF use case for the keys subsystem (security/keys/dh.c),=20
selecting the type of KDF would only necessitate a change of a string=20
referencing the KDF. A lot of people somehow favor the extract-and-expand K=
DFs=20
over the traditional KDFs. Now, that the RFC5869 HKDF is also approved as p=
er=20
SP800-56A rev3, I could see that folks may want to switch to HKDF for the k=
ey=20
management. When we have a common API, this choice could even be left to th=
e=20
caller.

The question may arise why to plug the KDFs into RNGs. The answer is quite=
=20
simple: KDFs are a form of random number generator. In that they take some=
=20
input for initialization (aka seed, salt, key, personalization string). The=
n=20
they produce pseudo-random bit sequences of arbitrary length. Possibly the=
=20
generation operation can be modified by providing some additional input to =
be=20
used by the generation process (aka label, context, info string, additional=
=20
information string). Thus, the RNG interface is a natural fit for the KDFs.

Ciao
Stephan
