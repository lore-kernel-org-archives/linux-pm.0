So maybe 'compatible =3D "qcom,pm8041-pon", "qcom,pm8941-pwrkey";'
with pm8941-pwrkey being marked as deprecated in the binding?

not much of a discussion if everyone agrees? :)

Ack.

Ack.

I don't think so. Adding a child node means, that we want to do
something based on the existance of this child node. So something,
that worked without the child node before no longer works
afterwards.

OTOH removing a child node means, that the child node is not needed
and stuff will work without it =3D> system still works.
