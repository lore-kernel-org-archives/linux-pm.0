I just suggested a solution of patching both drivers and omap_device
to make it easy for people to fix new drivers, so assuming that sounds
OK to you..

Heh me too :) It's probably worth checking the non omap_device drivers
thouhg.

I can check and fix up the omap_device using drivers. So roughly it's
these ones:

$ git grep pm_runtime_use_autosuspend drivers | cut -d: -f1 | \
	sort | uniq | grep omap
drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-omap.c
drivers/mmc/host/omap_hsmmc.c
drivers/spi/spi-omap2-mcspi.c
drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_omap.c
drivers/tty/serial/omap-serial.c

Yes and any sections within the driver code where clocks really
should be disabled we must use pm_runtime_put_sync_suspend() if
pm_runtime_set_autoidle() is set.
