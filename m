That looks really, really wrong. What's wrong with assigning that irq
irq number on those platforms?

The weird stuff is SFI and devicetree, if I understand your code
correctly.

So if those platforms do not have actual legacy irqs, what's wrong
with giving out the legacy numbers?

Ok.

Fair enough.
