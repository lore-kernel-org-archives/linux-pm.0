Good that you brought this up. From my point of view I think the sysfs
for runtime PM could be debated whether it should exist at all, at
least in it's current form.

Anyway, if userspace decides to prevent runtime_suspend, I guess it
will have take the consequences for it as well. :-)

In the end I suppose what case that is most common should win. :-) At
the same time, we should go slowly forward and it is probably not
realistic to convert each and every driver in one go.

So as a way forward, I am thinking of a similar approach as you
suggested with the "generic" suspend_late. But instead add a new
runtime PM API, which intent is to let drivers to specify for PM core,
if it should care to prevent the runtime suspend from happen during
system system - or not. Could that work?

Kind regards
