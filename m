Hm, indeed I did ;)

Right. I guess the scenario I wanted to describe is when we press a key
to put mobile sysem in a lower power mode (shut of screen, block
certain keys, and so on) but that not necessarily means that entire
system is sleeping.

Could be, it depends.

It may or it may not wake up the device and/or system.

It depends.

I do not believe there is a generic answer - different devices,
different options. For example I could see buttons split into 2 groups -
"important" ones that bring the system from sleep or "stupor" and "not
so important" that gets to be ignored. Or user woudl need to "flick"
the screen. Or toss the phone into a corner cussing :)

The point is that there seems to be a need for kicking devices into low
power mode and I woudl like to have generic interface for that,
preferrably reusing (as far as kernel drivers go) existing PM
infrastructure.
