Let me try to understand the scenario in the first place.

To start with, a number of devices is in use (that is, open, there are
applications listening/talking to them etc).  Now, an event happens, such
as a laptop lid close and you want some of those devices, but possibly
not all of them, to quiesce themselves and go into low-power states.

Is that correct?
