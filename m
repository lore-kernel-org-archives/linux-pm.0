Sorry I was evidently being too subtle.

The point is that if, as you acknowledge, that you can't train firmware
engineers to be responsive, there's no reason to think you can train
software engineers in the same quality ... they're very similar people.

The corollary is that real world systems have to operate in the face of
misbehaving hardware *and* software.
