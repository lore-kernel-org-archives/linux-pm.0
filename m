Hello,

I try to understand the cpuidle main concept but have some
difficulties. I could not find any documentation to explain the
cpuidle.

what does it mean that it enters idle when "no thread to run" ?if I
have only one process which does only
while(1)
{
 printf("C");
mdelay(1000);
}
Can I expect it to enter idle for 1 second and then print "C" and get
again to idle ?

Thanks
Ran
