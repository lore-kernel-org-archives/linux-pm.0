Thanks.

I was thinking about merging everything through one tree because of
the dependency (successive patches depend on previous) but I don't
mind choosing different strategy. However if you picked this one maybe
you can also apply the patch 1/9:
mfd/extcon: max77693: Remove unused extern declarations and max77693_dev members

It already got ack from Chanwoo.

Other patches depend on these so either everything will go through
your tree or you will prepare an immutable branch for e.g. Mark (as
everything is around regulator drivers).

Anyway I need some input from Mark about the patches 4, 5 and 9. Rest
of them already have his ack.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
