Hi All,

The following part of the original cover letter still applies:

but I had to rework the core patches to address the problem pointed with the
generic power domains (genpd) framework pointed out by Ulf.

Namely, genpd expects its "noirq" callbacks to be invoked for devices in
runtime suspend too and it has valid reasons for that, so its "noirq"
callbacks can never be skipped, even for devices with the SMART_SUSPEND
flag set.  For this reason, the logic related to DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND
had to be moved from the core to the PCI bus type and the ACPI PM domain
which are mostly affected by it anyway.  The code after the changes looks
more straightforward to me, but it generally is more code and some patterns
had to be repeated in a few places.

I also fixed a minor issue in the ACPI PM domain part of the first patch which
interpreted the lack of a driver ->prepare callback as an indication that the
driver refuses to participate in the direct-complete optimization if
DPM_FLAG_SMART_PREPARE is set for the given device (the flag should be ignored
in that case, but arguably setting it and failing to provide a ->prepare
callback would be sort of inconsistent anyway).

This series includes the core, PCI and ACPI PM domain part of the patches
introducing the NEVER_SKIP, SMART_PREPARE and SMART_SUSPEND flags plus one
extra PCI patch that hasn't changed from the previous iteration.  It is
based on the linux-next branch of the linux-pm.git tree that should be
included in linux-next.

I will send the core patches for the remaining two flags introduced by the
original series separately and the intel-lpss and i2c-designware ones will
be posted when the core patches have been reviewed and agreed on.

I have retained the Greg's ACKs on everything (as discussed with Greg offline)
and the Bjorn's ACKs on the majority of PCI changes (as they are essentially
the same as before) except for patch [5/6] which changed quite a bit from its
previous version (although it really implements the same behavior from the
PCI perspective).

Thanks,
Rafael
