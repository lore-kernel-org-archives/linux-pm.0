I know of two ways to prevent lost wakeup events. Reset a timeout
every time you receive a wakeup event or prevents suspend until you
know the event has been fully processed. Does your solution fall onto
one of these two categories, or do you have a third way?

That is not a correct statement. A trusted apps can call into an
untrusted app, it just has to validate the response and handle not
getting a response at all. There are also different levels of trust. I
may have trusted an app to provide a contact pictures, but not trusted
it to block suspend. When the phone rings the app will be called to
provide the picture for the incoming call dialog, but if it is frozen
at this point the more trusted app that handles the incoming phone
call will not be able to get the picture.

I don't think that is a fair way to put it. We need to support our
user-space framework and I have not seen an alternative solution that
clearly will work (other than replacing suspend_blockers with pm_qos
constraints that do the same thing).
