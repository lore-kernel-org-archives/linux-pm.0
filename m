'echo enabled > /sys/devices/platform/i8042/serio0/power/wakeup' can get the
keyboard wake up the system as expected. We considered to work out a DMI
based quirk for this. But based on the information that EC would not signal SCI
event for WiskyLake models, we'd like to know if there's any generic solution?
Maybe a 'udev' rule to identify WiskyLake NoteBook then enable the keyboard
wake up?
