In the PCI case that is an extra wakeup mechanism that the upper layer doesn't
need to know about.

In other cases it may be the only one in which the upper layer may or may not
be interested.

I guess the point is, rather, that the upper layer may not be able to make
decisions based on the value of device_may_wakeup() alone, which is fair
enough, but then how to provide it with the extra information and what that
information should be still is a matter of discussion IMO.

You seem to be focusing on the wakeup_path approach which hasn't even been
designed for that.  Setting wakeup_path doesn't really tell the upper layers
what wakeup mechanism exactly is going to be used, does it?

So maybe we should try to define the problem more precisely ...

That doesn't matter.  In any case that information has to be available to the
driver at the probe time.

Sure, it may.

Right, but that's not the whole story.

The upper layer may or may not recognize the concept of "wakeup".  The PCI
bus type and the ACPI PM domain do recognize it and in their view it is the
standard wakeup mechanisms to be used.  Everything beyond that is not
recognized.  genpd doesn't really understand wakeup.  It only understands
turning off/on domains and stopping/starting devices (and that may or may
not understand wakeup, but the framework is oblivious to that).  So whatever
mechanism you think about should be generic enough to match all of these
different cases.

Moreover, in fact, it should cover runtime PM too, because "wakeup" is not
just limited to system-wide PM.

So maybe let's just take a step back and have a deeper look at things to
see what *really* needs to be addressed.

Exactly.

Well, we'll see.
