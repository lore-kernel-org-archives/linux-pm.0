Okay, we can agree on this.  Adding an interface to accelerate (or cut
short) an autosuspend timeout makes sense, and it should handle all the 
cases the two of you have mentioned.

Rafael might want more, however, although I'm not sure exactly what he
would like to have.

I still disagree.  The user should be able to tell the driver that he's
not going to be using the keypad, touch panel, or whatever in the near
future... but it's up the driver to decide whether or not to go to low
power.

Although such dependencies do sometimes make things awkward,
occasionally you need to have them.  But I still don't see how this is
connected with system suspend, or how autosuspend conflicts with system
suspend.
