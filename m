Well, as I just wrote in a different message, what he _really_ wants is to
get maximum possible battery life and he found experimentally that this is
achieved by suspending the whole system as often as reasonably possible.

Of course, the "reasonably possible" part needs clarification.

We could avoid that if drivers could block tasks, but there are questions to
answer.  First off, how a driver is supposed to know when to block the task
using it and when to do its power management transparently for the task?
Second, how to intercept and block all possible interfaces that user space
can use to talk to drivers (how to intercept a task using mmapped device, for
example)?
