Ah, now I see what you mean. I thought the problem was during the
actual restoring of the hibernation image.

Alright, when a boot is triggered by WOWLAN , you want to avoid
sending the reset command for the SDIO card before the
re-initialization of the SDIO card starts.

The problem with this approach is that you can't differentiate between
a cold boot and a boot triggered by WOWLAN, right!? In other words, in
some cases the reset command may be needed while in other it won't.

Maybe you can elaborate more on what exactly what the problem is with
sending the reset command when the boot is triggered from WOWLAN? Yes,
the SDIO card loses its context, but how is that a problem?

Kind regards
