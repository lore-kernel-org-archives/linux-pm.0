A better solution could be to have bool Kconfig, say
THERMAL_EMERGENCY_POWEROFF, which would default to false. If one selects
that option, you get the DELAY_MS configurable, and then you could get
the 0 ms still as a valid entry, with the same semantics of immediate
power off, no orderly_poweroff.

I just want to avoid breaking everybody (or changing userland
expectation) in honor of this change.
