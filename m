Seems this got merged and is already part of master, even though the binding it
uses is not yet finalized or accepted. I am about to send v2 of the ti-cpufreq
series that makes use of these bindings, and I will be sending a series to fix
these nodes that has already been merged, however it should *NOT* be merged.
until the binding and driver have been merged, as it could still potentially change.

Also, this series replaced the OPP v1 tables for am33xx and dra7, so cpufreq is
no longer enabled at the moment for these platforms. To fix this we could revert
patches:

f80bc97fd0a9 ("ARM: dts: dra7: Move to operating-points-v2 table")
c36e6ec90487 ("ARM: dts: am335x-boneblack: Enable 1GHz OPP for cpu")
4317be116210 ("ARM: dts: am33xx: Move to operating-points-v2 table and
ti-cpufreq driver")

until the ti-cpufreq driver series is merged, at which point we can add them
back in to re-enable cpufreq with the new driver.

Regards,
Dave
