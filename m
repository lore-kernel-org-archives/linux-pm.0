Probably not, I think the delayed approach is better.

I guess the "mask-IRQ, pm_runtime_get(), return" approach would work
here too.  But I agree with you about the drivers having to handle both
of these cases is not the greatest.

It already concerns me since I'm working on SMP OMAPs too.  The OMAP4 is
a dual ARM Cortex A9[1].

Not sure I follow where you're going with this last paragraph.  Of
course, calls from ISR context cannot busy wait.
