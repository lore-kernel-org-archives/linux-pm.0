I applied these to pci/pm for v4.10, thanks!

I did make two changes to the changelog of the last patch: you
mentioned the "subordinate" bus, and I changed it to "secondary".  We
have often used "subordinate" to refer to the immediately-downstream
bus, but that's slightly confusing because in the bridge spec,
"subordinate" means the highest bus number downstream from the bridge,
while "secondary" refers to the immediately-downstream bridge.  Am I
making sense or confusing things more?
