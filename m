But see questions below, stemming from my ignorance of ACPI PM.  I
don't want to start a discussion and delay this.  If my questions
don't suggest any useful changes, please ignore them.

It looks like @max_count is always either 1 or INT_MAX, so it's
effectively a boolean.  Is there a way to interpret @max_count in
terms of the PCI topology?  It's obviously related to
wakeup->enable_count; does wakeup->enable_count basically mean "the
number of subordinate devices that are enabled to generate wakeups"?

__acpi_pm_set_device_wakeup() is exported; maybe only to make the
inlined callers in acpi_bus.h work?  It might be worth un-inlining
them to avoid having to export __acpi_pm_set_device_wakeup().  I'm
just thinking that exporting it makes it visible everywhere, and
@max_count seems like an internal detail that's hard to document for
use by non-core code.

I guess you still have to export both acpi_pm_set_device_wakeup()
(currently already exported) and acpi_pm_set_bridge_wakeup()
(this patch effectively exports it by implementing it as an inline
function).

It'd be nice if we could distinguish the device case from the bridge
case inside acpi_pm_set_device_wakeup() so we wouldn't have to rely on
the caller using the correct one.  But I assume you already considered
that and found it impractical.
