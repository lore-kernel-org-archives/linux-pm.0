Yeah, I agree that terminology is a bit tricky here, and we have some
words conveying a specific idea already ("suspend"). To me, deactivating
suggests a more permanent condition. FWIW, I've used "inhibit" in this
context before and think it captures the idea well, to add another
choice to the list.

That's the idea, yes, and I think this would be desirable for the input
device class at least.

I guess we could potentially leave this for the device class to decide.

I'm not sure what the appropriate action for a video camera is anyway.
Should it go away completely, including its device? Should it be there,
but certainly not be the default choice when there is an external
camera? I'm thinking along the lines of some application's settings
dialog here, where it might be desirable to still be able to select the
internal camera for future recordings.

Of course, userspace could still decide simply not to
quiesce|deactivate|inhibit the device if that was desired.
