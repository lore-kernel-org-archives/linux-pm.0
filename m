Hm... so simply:

if (mq->flags & MMC_QUEUE_SUSPENDED)
  schedule();

?

This whole kthread business is pretty messy. I would prefer if I could
just convert it to a workqueue. Just that it's not very simple the way
it speculates around in the request queue from the block layer.

I guess we should take the queue lock &q->lock around accessing
the flags.
