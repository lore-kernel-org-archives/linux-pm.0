I like the idea but that requires to extend the current API with
additional suspend tracepoints or device state change tracepoints.
That can be done once the current API is firmly in place.
Today the only trace API for suspend is machine_suspend(unsigned int
state), so I think the best option is 3) here above.

Unless there is an objection I am pushing 3) asap.

Thanks!
