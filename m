Sure, but it's easy enough for subsystems that need protection to add
it.  Why not just better document that driver & subsytem runtime PM
callbacks *could* be called during a system suspend (and same for
resume.)  Any subsystems that want/need protection can prevent nesting
simply with pm_runtime_get_noresume() and _put_noidle().

As I mentioned earlier in the thread, this can already happen today
without .suspend() callbacks directly calling pm_runtime_suspend()
(e.g. driver xfer finishes and does pm_runtime_put_sync() anytime after
system suspend has started.)

Partially, yes.  But I'm not primarily concerned about the callbacks.
Many of our simple drivers don't even need runtime PM callbacks
(e.g. state is saved using shadow regs, or device is re-init'd for for
every xfer etc.)

More important to me is how driver writers for embedded devices think
about PM for embedded systems.  IMO, driver writers should think
primarily in terms of runtime PM, and use that as the primary API for
all driver PM.

>From my POV, system PM for embedded devices is just a special case of
runtime PM.  From a device driver perspective, system PM is just runtime
PM where the "idleness" was forced and only a subset of possible wakeup
sources are enabled.   I think this runtime-PM-centric view of the world
is maybe where our differences of opinion are coming from.

So with that perspecive, I'd like the code to reflect a
runtime-PM-centric view as well.  The development effort is primarily
focused on implementing efficient runtime PM for an _active_ system.
When this is working, implementing system PM is easy: all that is needed
is to enable/disable relevant wakeups and force the device to idle.
This allows runtime PM to trigger, and the device is suspended.

Yes, for OMAP, the "really suspending" work is done by the subsystem.

Exactly.

I still don't quite see what runtime_suspend() would do wrong in terms
of wakeups.  Do you mean that subsys->runtime_suspend() might enable
wakeups even though subsys->suspend() has just disabled them?  If so, it
should be the responsibility of the subsystem to manage this correctly.  

It would be pretty straightforward for the subsystem to know if its
.runtime_suspend() is being called during system suspend (e.g. flag set
during ->prepare, etc.) and not mess with wakeup settings.

At least on OMAP, this isn't an issue since the runtime PM path doesn't
touch wakeups at all.  Wakeup-capable devices have wakeups enabled
during device init, and remain wakeup capable during runtime PM.
Neither the driver or subsystem runtime PM callbacks do anything for
wakeups.  Only the driver (or possibly subsystem) .suspend() and
.resume() do any changing of wakeup settings.

Do you have something in mind about how they wouldn't play well
together?  

I'm starting from the assumption that subsystems need to be aware or
potential nesting of callbacks (which can happen today), and either take
care of it or prevent it.

If the HW really needs different handling for system suspend and runtime
PM, then I see your point, and the subsystem is free to treat them more
independently, and even to prevent them from nesting.  My point is that
for embedded systems, there is no difference at the HW other than wakeup
programming, and wakeups are easy enough to handle.

Yes, all of this means that the subsystem has to be written with this
runtime-PM-centric view in mind, but I am pursuaded that doing so is the
best model for the PM domains on embedded devices.

Put differently, with a runtime-PM-centric view of the world, the
subsystem .suspend really has nothing to do, so it is rather easy for it
to play well with .runtime_suspend().  The driver .suspend will
enable/disable wakeups, quiesce the HW, and as a result a runtime PM
transition will occur.   Then there's nothing left for the subsystem
.suspend to do.

Maybe it helps to show the flow of how I think this would work for a
typical device during system suspend:

subsys->suspend()
    driver->suspend()
        /* check device_may_wakeup(), enable/disable wakeups */
        /* quiesce HW, triggers runtime PM _put() or _suspend() */
        subsys->runtime_suspend()
            driver->runtime_suspend()
                driver_save_context()
            /* subsys idles HW, sets low-power state */
        /* nothing left for driver to do */
    /* nothing left for subsys to do */

I don't follow this part.

So you're not OK with running the subsystem or driver .runtime_suspend()
during .suspend(), but it is OK during .suspend_noirq()? 

Also, where/when would the subsystem .runtime_suspend() be called?
