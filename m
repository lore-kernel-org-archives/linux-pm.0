The above paragraph and the following two in the commit message are
intended to explain the need for this additional bit in struct pci_dev.

Yes, the bit is set on all PCI devices that are part of the Thunderbolt
controller (upstream bridge, downstream bridges, NHI and on Thunderbolt 3
there's also an XHCI) as well as on all PCI devices below it.

That's why it says /* part of Thunderbolt daisy chain */ in the line
added to pci.h at the bottom of this patch.

It's just another example why this bit in struct pci_dev is needed:

Dual GPU MacBook Pros introduced before 2011 are able to switch the
external DisplayPort between GPUs.  All newer models lost this ability
and the external port can only be driven by the discrete GPU.  That's
because the port is no longer just used for DisplayPort, it's become a
combined DP/Thunderbolt port.  I guess the wiring would have been too
complicated to keep the external port switchable between GPUs and also
use it for Thunderbolt.  They already had to go to great lengths and
put various redrivers on the logic board to support the combined
DP/thunderbolt port.

We need to recognize if the model has Thunderbolt and in that case keep
the external port switched to the discrete GPU.  I have a patch for this
in the pipeline but this one needs to go in first.

nouveau, radeon and amdgpu register any GPU they find with vga_switcheroo,
but vga_switcheroo only becomes enabled if the system has Optimus, AMD
PowerXpress or an apple-gmux controller.

If the user connects an external GPU to a dual GPU laptop, that external
GPU will be registered with vga_switcheroo as well.  When that external
GPU runtime suspends, vga_switcheroo will invoke the callback to cut
power to the internal discrete GPU and obviously things go south at that
point.

The solution is to not register external GPUs with vga_switcheroo at all.
For this I need the is_thunderbolt bit.

I thought that we may have the necessity in the future to parse other
VSECs on device probe, so I gave the function this generic name.

Think about it, every VSEC that needs to be parsed needs the while loop
below.  It's more efficient to have only a single while loop that handles
*all* VSECs at once.

If someone needs to parse another VSEC, they just add it to this function.
So IMO the way I've solved it is preferable to just adding a Thunderbolt-
specific function.

Are you sure you want this renamed? (y/n)

Well, see above.  I don't want to return here to allow parsing other VSECs.
