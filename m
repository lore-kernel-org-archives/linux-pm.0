OK. will do, thanks for suggesting the same.

The only other options are:
a) Abstract it at a higher level at "user drivers", since they are
aware of the sequencing needs - but this partially defeats the
purpose, unless ofcourse, we do a tricky implementation such as:
clk a, b, c -> prenotifiers in a, postnotifiers in c (which as you
mentioned is a little trickier to get right).
b) introduce a higher level generic dvfs function[1] which does not
seem very attractive either.


Any other suggestions other than limiting the usage(and documenting it
so) and hoping for a future evolution to take this into consideration?
