Well, we have similar problem during runtime, too ;-).

Anyway, I don't think we should encrypt memory during S3 in kernel.

If you wanted to do that, you could use uswsusp to take snapshot,
store it in ram, encrypt, erase originals (new API might be
needed... hmm. does not exactly sound easy... kexec?), trigger S3, decrypt,
resume from snapshot...

Sounds like a bit of work...
