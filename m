This patch looks fine to me.

But I wonder whether it's correct for pci_pm_suspend_noirq() (and the
other PM functions) to use pci_has_subordinate() as opposed to
pci_is_bridge().

pci_is_bridge() is true for all bridge devices (plain old PCI-PCI
bridges, PCIe ports, CardBus bridges, etc.)

pci_has_subordinate() is true only if the bridge has a struct pci_bus
allocated for its secondary bus.  This is probably the case for all or
almost all bridges, but it's conceivable that if we don't have enough
bus number space for the secondary bus, we might not allocate that
struct pci_bus.

What do you PM guys think?  I don't know what you would want to do
with a bridge that didn't have any reachable devices below it.
