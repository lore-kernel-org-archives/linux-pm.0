Unfortunately not. I have discussed with hardware guys. They confirmed me
that the power consumption to keep the interface enabled is very low but it
will be difficult to measure the consumption difference between the two
options because it would be minimal.

If in practice the result was almost the same, it is not useful to
continue this debate. I'll keep the polling workaround and I'll update system
PM callbacks.
