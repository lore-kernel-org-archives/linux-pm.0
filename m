Hello Greg,

Here is a series of fixes and I am also updating and revising
the TODO list.

The fixes present in this series  are:
. Extrapolation rules for OMAP4/5 (have been updated)
. Defer probe whenever cpufreq is not ready (Thanks to Keerthy for reporting)
. Device removal was checking for wrong callback

The TODO list has shrink as many of them was already DONE by
previous series of patches.

These patches are based on top of your staging-next. Tested
on OMAP4430 and OMAP5430.

These patches are also available here:
git@gitorious.org:thermal-framework/thermal-framework.git thermal_work/omap/ti-soc-thermal-fixes

All best,
