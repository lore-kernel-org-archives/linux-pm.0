I wouldn't say it's up to the engineer himself, it's more related to how 
the company that person works for deal with such things.

I still think the kernel shouldn't deal with broken applications and we

find them and have all sorts of bells and whistles shouting 'process 
%s is preventing CPU from sleeping for %llu nanoseconds' or something 
like that.
