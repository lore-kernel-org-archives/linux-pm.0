The examples cited where the things like the Palm Pre, and the Nokia
N770/800/810 series.  #1, what works on one embedded
chipset/architecture might not work on another, and #2, the battery
lifetime on the N770 and N800 (both of which I have) is **appalling**
**bad**.

I really don't understand why people are so opposed to merging code
that works well for a very large set of devices and products.  Just
because *you* don't need it is not a sufficiently good reason to argue
for it not be merged.  If you don't want to use it, then don't CONFIG
it in.
