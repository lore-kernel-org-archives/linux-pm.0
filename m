OK thanks I've applied these into am335x-cpufreq-regression branch
and merging that into omap-for-v4.9/dt-v2 branch as well. Seems
like no huge rush to get these into v4.8-rc series as nobody has
noticed since May. And we can request these for stable inclusion
after they hit mainline. If there is need to have these in v4.8-rc,
let me know and I'll send a pull request for am335x-cpufreq-regression
separately.

Regards,

Tony
