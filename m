There is no reasonable fallback.  In fact, I seriously doubt that
there's any way to carry this out at all, reasonable or not.  For
example, how do you handle the situation where a user task gets an
error because it accessed an mmapped address belonging to a device that
has been suspended?

Firstly, it's not at all clear that this _is_ the right thing.

Secondly, when doing the right thing involves making invasive changes 
to half the .c files in the kernel, people might stop to think that it 
would add more bugs than it would solve problems.
