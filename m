oops...so there's no section for PCI device here, maybe i should add a 
section about "PCI device have standardized Device Tree bindings:" to 
place it? will do in next version.

actually it could...

static void *of_pci_setup(struct device *dev)
{
...
         device_init_wakeup(dev, false);

         dev_info(dev, "Wakeup IRQ %d\n", irq);
         return data;
}

ok, will do in next version...
