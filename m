Sorry for replying late...

I see your concern, but it should be safe here. The dev_pm_domain_attach
does primarily two things(for ACPI based system): assign the pm_domian
field so that later system and runtime PM transitions we have proper
callbacks for this device; power on the device if needed.

I was using Broadcom BCM43241 SDIO wifi card when developing the code,
it doesn't need the pm_domain set in its probe function and since the
SDIO wifi card is powered on after system boot, no power on is needed
either. That's why I added the attach function after device_add to save
a little code(detach if probe fails).

Feel free to change the sequence if the current one is a bad one, I'm OK
with either case.
