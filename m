Naive questions: Does this indicate that xhci_hcd is lacking something
in the "resume from D3cold" path?  Is there a bugzilla for this?  If
not, can you open one and attach the complete dmesg log and complete
"lspci -vv" output (as root)?  Google found some possibly related
issues but I can't quite tie them together yet.

I don't have an issue with the quirk per se, but in general I think
it's better to debug an issue than simply avoid it.
