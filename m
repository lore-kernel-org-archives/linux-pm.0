Here is the scenario.  The kernel has just booted.  User space wants to try
to restore a hibernation image, if there is one.  So user space loads the
mmc core because the hibernation image is on eMMC.  Mmc core does an SDIO
reset on the SDIO card and the state is lost.  It has little to do with pm
callbacks AFAICS.
