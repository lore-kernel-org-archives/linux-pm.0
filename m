I guess because PCI requires delays of 10ms for both directions D0 <->
D3hot (see pci_raw_set_power_state()).

B3 is the state where the bus goes when it's power is removed so I would
expect that to require also the 50ms even though the spec does not
explicitly say so.

I can try but it is not always easy to find the right person in company
as big as Intel.
