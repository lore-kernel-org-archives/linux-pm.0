If the PM domain controls some resources for the device in its RPM
callbacks and the driver controls some other resources in its RPM
callbacks - then these resources needs to be managed together.

This follows the behavior of when a regular call to
pm_runtime_get|put(), triggers the RPM callbacks to be invoked.

Yes!

You may think of it as genpd's RPM callback controls some device
clocks, while the driver control some other device resources (pinctrl
for example) from its RPM callback.

These resources needs to managed together, similar to as I described above.

Correct!

To use pm_runtime_force* for these cases, one would need some
additional information exchange between the driver and the
middle-layer.

Okay, that makes sense!

Actually no.

Currently the other options of "deferring resume" (not using
pm_runtime_force_*), is either using the "direct_complete" path or
similar to the approach you took for the i2c designware driver.

Both cases should play nicely in combination of a child being managed
by pm_runtime_force_*. That's because only when the parent device is
kept runtime suspended during system suspend, resuming can be
deferred.

That means, if the resume of the parent is deferred, so will the also
the resume of the child.

Yes, reaching that point would be great, we should definitively aim for that!
