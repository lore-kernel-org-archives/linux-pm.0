Sorry for being the bottleneck here.

This has been in my todo list all the time, but I get pulled away from
it on a regular basis due to regressions and similar.

I've read this, but I still don't quite understand the problem to be
honest.  I'll have another look.

I don't think so, because setting a PM domain generally changes the
set of PM callbacks for the device and it may not be safe to call it
after the driver has been bound.

Well, honestly, you may be underestimating the amount of time needed
for me to understand the problem you're trying to solve.

Thanks,
