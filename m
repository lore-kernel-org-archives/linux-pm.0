This is the bug I described above. If the app that blocked suspend did
not release the suspend blocker and went idle, then another while(1)
app will drain the battery. If the app that blocked suspend only
blocked suspend while it needs to run (which is the typical reason to
block suspend) then the system is not idle anyway and the impact of
the while(1) app is much less severe.
