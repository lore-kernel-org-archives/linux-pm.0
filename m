Hi Ying,

I'm now face one bug, and the root cause is this logic has some problem.

The other component calls the ops in driver during probe state, which a 
lot of critical data struct haven't been setup yet.

This never happen in old logic, because dev->driver is unset in probe 
state, it can check dev->driver to see if the device diver can work. But 
for new logic it is really a big issue.

Shall I add an other flag like 'unsigned int probe_state:1' in struct 
pci_dev instead of setting dev->driver before probe and change the logic 
back?

Then in pci_pm_runtime_xxx() can check this flag instead of pci_dev->driver.

If my logic does not affect your PM logic, I will send out the patch for 
review. Otherwise I will consider other solutions.

Thanks
Mike
