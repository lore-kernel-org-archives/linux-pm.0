Yup, that's the bug here. It seems that we never call the runtime_suspend
callback at the end of a first failed device driver probe if the driver
has set pm_runtime_use_autosuspend. Only rpm_idle runtime_idle callback
gets called. So the device stays on.

This does not happen if pm_runtime_dont_use_autosuspend() is added to
the end of the device driver probe before pm_runtime_put_sync().

That's a valid error though, let's not remove it. The reason why we
call runtime_resume() twice is because runtime_suspend callback never
gets called like I explain above.

FYI, the following allows runtime_suspend callback to get called at the
end of a failed driver probe so the hardware state matches the PM runtime
state. Need to debug more.

Tony
