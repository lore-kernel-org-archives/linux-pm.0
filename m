You should request irq as late as possible in probe - it's safest way to go always.
You see crushes simply because request_irq enables IRQ and IRQ can trigger immediately, so
IRQ handler will run and all required resources should be ready and initialized.

In this case:
twl4030_bci_interrupt() -> twl4030_charger_update_current() -> ac_available() -> iio_read_channel_processed()
OOOPS.

So, first thing to do is to reorder probe to ensure that sequence is safe.
Then other stuff - devm, EPROBE_DEFER ...
