Right, because the moment we introduce the combination/aggregation mechanism
is the moment "effective" value makes sense to have. That's when the
code show that:

   a task cannot always get what it "request", an "effective" value is
   computed by aggregation and that's the value we use now for actual
   clamp enforcing.

If you prefer, I can use effective values since the beginning and then
add the "requested" values later... but I fear the patchset will not
be more clear to parse.

Mmm... don't get this point...

AFAICS "mapping" and "effective" are two different concepts, that's
why I can probably get rid of the first by I would prefer to keep the
second.

:( I'm really sorry I'm not able to convey the overall design idea.

TBH however, despite being a quite "limited" feature it has many
different viewpoints: task-specific, cgroups and system defaults.

I've really tried my best to come up with something reasonable but I
understand that, looking at the single patches, the overall design
could be difficult to grasp... without considering that optimizations
are always possible of course.

If you like better, I can try to give a respin by just removing the
mapping part and then we go back and see if the reaming bits makes
more sense ?
