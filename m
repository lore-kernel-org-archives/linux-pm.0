Would you explain why user space doesn't simply stop using those
devices, which in turn will make them idle? There are obvious cases
like keyboards or SCSI hosts where the kernel controls stuff, but could
you state where you expect this to be most useful?
Or why devices cannot be closed, e.g. you need to be sure settings
be not lost or is it something else?

Now these are two distinct questions.

1. a common interface
2. a capability implemented in common code

It is important to keep that apart. I suppose if we want this at all
#1 is a given. #2 however may be impossible in a generic manner

That is highly problematic. You'd need to audit the locking in every
driver. Right now elevating the count means that suspend()/resume()
cannot race with user space, as in the case of the system suspending
user space is frozen.

That is obviously not enough. Take the worst case: we are flashing some
firmware. Or far more harmless: a key is has been pressed on a keyboard

For some drivers. But it needs support in the driver. Right now we can
make a device idle by calling close(). In fact we can benefit for
example in mice from this. But it needs support in the drivers.

That would have to be done on a per driver base.

No. If we want this at all, we need a new callback to notify drivers
that user space is temporarily uninterested in a device. And the reverse
of course.
The power model is good. We must not assume that devices can be
suspended at will. If we do this at all, we ought to see it as giving
strong hints to drivers when a device can be considered idle.
