yes. example - https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/183742/ (based on 
original patch posted to l-arm, this will need some tweaks with the 
latest evolution, the concepts remain the same).

For example, consider in the patch above where we have a opp definitions 
we can choose from omap3430 and 3630,

when using 3630 silicon as a specific, certain boards wish to enable 
1GHz, this allows us to do something as follows:
in the generic omap code, we do init of all opps
in the board specific file, we enable 1Ghz

The selection of oppset and actual availability is done on the fly.

I had intended domains linked to an IP Block within an SOC - in the case 
of OMAP as an example we may have scenarios where voltage levels are 
optimized beyond those defined in the original OPP tables using a TI 
hardware IP called SmartReflex AVS (ok many SOCs probably are not that 
complex.. but it is a cool feature to enable improve the power 
consumption). more: 
http://www.powersystemsdesign.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=168&Itemid=107

So in reality once you enable you'd have a lot more tuples of (Fx, 
Vnom),(Fx, Vopt1), (Fx, Vopt2).... where (Fx, Vnom) is the original opp 
definition.

Unfortunately our framework for supporting this is still in churn and 
probably not ready for upstream yet.

yes, it is prefered to allow this to be SOC specific - every SOC 
(including various OMAP families) have their capabilities allowing them 
to implement the detection and configuration differently.. maybe device 
trees could be in use in one SOCx, but SOCy might choose to implement a 
run time detection as demonstrated in the link above.

probably a dumb question: Is'nt it enough to give detailed verbose 
information in the  struct comment header? why duplicate here as well.. 
other than giving an overview?

could you help and point these to me. opp_find_freq_exact, 
opp_find_freq_ceil, opp_find_freq_floor are the only ones that return 
pointers and they need to return the pointer to the opp they found to 
operate on them such as add_freq etc..

I assume you are expecting to get a little more verbose data here to the 
effect:
2. opp_find_freq_exact - function to find an opp with exact match to a 
provided frequency
3. opp_find_freq_floor - function to find an opp with rounded floor 
match to a provided frequency
4. opp_find_freq_ceil - function to find an opp with rounded ceil match 
to a provided frequency

:) This is more from the real way folks who use the OPP on thier 
platforms face. As an example: OMAP3630 supports 100MHz and 200MHz for 
the L3 bus driving DDR. some platforms choose not to have 200MHz DDR due 
to some internal reasons, instead they choose a DDR - for the sake of 
argument say 166MHz. This is not actually "official OPP" from TI 
perspective, but these platforms need to do:
init_omap_default_opps()
add_my_custom_166MHz_opp()
disable_the_default_200MHz()

Disclaimer to prevent OMAP guys from flaming me: the values used in my 
example are hypothetical and is not an official statement from TI to use 
166MHz on OMAP3630 ;). But there are folks not using 200MHz and they 
know the pain if this runtime addition was not possible.

opp_get_opp_count gets the number of opps available for that domain - 
you may choose to setup some sort of array containing some special data 
on it.
cpufreq SOCs impleemntation might be told to go to a frequency, it makes 
sense for the implementation to pick up the opp pointer  with search 
function and call opp_get_voltage to get the voltage to scale voltage etc..

Or am I missing your intent here? I did not intend to explain the 
concept of power management in this documentation..

ok, a repeat question -> why duplicate the information defined in the 
structure comment header?
