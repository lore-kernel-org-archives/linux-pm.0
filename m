Because D3_hot is the deepest state you can *program* the device to go into
unless the platform can cut off power from it.

Then it should not be put into D3_cold at run time too if it is wakeup-capable.

That would have been the case if the device had been capable of signaling
wakeup from D3_cold at run time, but not from system sleep.  However, that
can only happen when platform_pci_power_manageable() is true AFAICS.

So I'd change the switch () under the platform_pci_power_manageable() check to
return "state" in the default case and then do

	return dev->current_state < target_state ? target_state : dev->current_state;

at the end of the function.

Thanks,
Rafael
