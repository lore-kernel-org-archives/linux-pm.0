First off, we're doing this already (user space can block runtime PM, for
one example, because there are systems where runtime PM doesn't work
although it works on other systems with analogous hardware and pretty
much the same set of drivers).

Second, I think there are valid use cases in which user space _really_ knows
better than the kernel.  I'm opposed to the idea that users shouldn't be given
control of their systems, because they may not know what they're doing.

Thanks,
Rafael
