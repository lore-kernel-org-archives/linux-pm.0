Hi,

Trying to catch up on this thread...

Wait, isn't 'dn' the port node, not the bridge node?

I believe my thinking has evolved a bit over time, and I definitely am
not the one true authority on this. I'll explain my main concerns, and
whatever solution resolves these concerns is fine with me.

* I was primarily interested in avoiding handling WAKE# in the endpoint
  drivers (e.g., as mwifiex is today).
* I was also interested in not having to redefine a new DT device
  node (with new "pciABCD,1234" compatible property) for each new device
  attached. That just won't work for removable cards.

I need to reread the rest of this thread a few times to really
understand what Rafael and Tony are discussing. But I feel like some of
this is still moving away from the second point above.
