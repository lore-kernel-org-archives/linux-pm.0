Yes, this should be the next stage to solve.

I had removed the entries for OPPs and clock nodes used by
omap-cpufreq.c and deleted the omap-cpufreq.c as well - so the statement
"CPUFreq wont work in non-DT" configuration was accurate.

My intent was as follows:
- This series is driven mainly from maintenance angle - having to maintain
two different drivers (legacy omap-cpufreq.c and cpufreq-cpu0.c),
ensuring the data is proper in both OPP tables in kernel and DT entries
is sure to cause mayhem sometime. This is not just an pain for OMAP
community, but for cpufreq community as well (since there is absolutely
no reason other than OMAP legacy burden for making cpu0-cpufreq work in non-DT
world).
- as long as non-DT supported boot provides all features, there is no
real feature incentive to move to DT.

But, that said, there is one path I see possible:
- keep omap-cpufreq alive (BUT I will add a patch that will not let it init
  when in DT entries are present)
- add DT entries for all relevant OMAPs - in DT mode, we will *only*
support cpufreq-cpu0
- All future SoCs will continue to use cpufreq-cpu0 using DT, as was the
alignment I believe.
