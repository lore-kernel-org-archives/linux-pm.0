Yes. Thanks for the pointers Tero.

As i had mentioned, Here is the log on DRA72-EVM with arago filesystem
over nfs on the next branch with my patch to restrict orderly_poweroff
to one cycle.

http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/24371980/

I triggered thermal shutdown by using THERMAL_EMULATION.

5-10S was on a good run and we can see that with a full size file system
over nfs its taking about 30+ seconds to orderly_poweroff.

I also profiled a poweroff command timing. That also takes more than 20
Seconds. Here is the log:
http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/24372012/

As Eduardo pointed out this is pretty long. I had 2 suggestions for that:

1) To decrease the thermal critical threshold below the actual hardware
thermal shutdown threshold.

2) To have a thermal_backup shutdown which uses kernel_power_off when a
configured time expires after we have triggered orderly_poweroff and
directly shuts off the system.

Keerthy
