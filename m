I don't believe you can answer that question without telepathy and a
crystal ball.

The application doesn't know because it has no idea how to balance
conflicting resource demands or to infer the users requirements and
wishes. Most apps will misbehave anyway.

The OS doesn't know because it cannot tell what the app wants

So at best you have a heuristic.

We keep it kernel side
It expresses policy and wishes rather than enforcing a behaviour.

What for example does "suspend_block" mean on a virtual machine ?

I would prefer "priority" was some kind of resource constraint model
instead but I'm just trying to think how to be absolutely minimally
invasible at this point.

"I don't think it works" isn't that helpful. I don't think it works
because .. would help me a lot more.

I think it's a loss let invasive because you are not exposing a ton of
stuff to user space in general (just some private chit chat between a
couple of processes). I would prefer it didn't even do that but simply
used QoS guarantees. However I don't see a way to achieve that given your
intended QoS guarantees change according to actions like screen off.
