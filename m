This is part of the trouble, it all feels like a lot more work than it
should be for relatively common cases.  In the audio case we're fine as
the subsystem implements a completely independent PM infrastructure
which ignores the PM core except for system suspend (and sometimes
ignores that), it's noticably harder to reason about what's going on
when I go outside there and when I think about what I'm doing it always
feels like it should be possible to factor it out of the drivers.

Yeah, though of course if you're only going to be resumed for a very
brief time anyway the amount of time you spend powering up and down
suddenly gets a lot more interesting.  Things like responding to a
keepalive from the network can be done quickly enough that people get
annoyed if you burn 10ms or whatever powering up some irrelevant bit of
hardware.

Right, I mostly agree - like I say I think the main thing that would be
useful here is to extend the helpers for the common case unified suspend
situation.  This may be totally separate to what Kevin needs, though.
