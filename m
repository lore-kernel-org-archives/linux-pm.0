Actually, it also is a matter of correctness, at least to some extent.

Namely, if the parent or any supplier of the device has
power.must_resume clear in dpm_noirq_resume_devices(), then the device
should not be touched during the whole system resume transition
(because the access may very well go through the suspended parent or
supplier) and the most straightforward way to make that happen is to
avoid running the code that may touch the device.  [Arguably, if
middle layers were made responsible for handling that, they would need
to do pretty much the same thing and so there is no reason for not
doing it in the core.]

Allowing the "noirq" callback from middle layers to run in that case
is a stretch already, but since genpd needs that, well, tough nuggets.

All of that said, if there is a middle layer wanting to set
power.skip_resume and needing to do something different for the resume
callbacks, then this piece can be moved from the core to the middle
layers at any time later.  So far there's none, though.  At least not
in this patch series.

Thanks,
Rafael
