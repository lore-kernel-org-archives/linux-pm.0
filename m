Think of it like rfkill. It makes sense to suspend an rfkilled device.
It still is the job of the driver to report that its device is idle.

"inhibit" -> driver stops input -> driver sets PM count to zero
-> PM subsystem acts

To go from the first to the second step a callback is needed

That too. We also save CPU cycles.

Yes, we can use the current API.
The key is that you think of the mechanism as induced idleness,
not forced suspend. We already have a perfectly working mechanism
for suspending idle devices.
