It's getting enabled by drivers/pci/pci-driver.c:local_pci_probe(),
before the sdhci-pci probe function runs.  local_pci_probe() does:

        /* Unbound PCI devices are always set to disabled and suspended.
         * During probe, the device is set to enabled and active and the
         * usage count is incremented.  If the driver supports runtime PM,
         * it should call pm_runtime_put_noidle() in its probe routine and
         * pm_runtime_get_noresume() in its remove routine.
         */
        pm_runtime_get_noresume(dev);
        pm_runtime_set_active(dev);
        pm_runtime_enable(dev);

and then the "Unbalanced pm_runtime_enable!" message appears when
sdhci_pci_probe() calls pm_runtime_enable() for the second time. =

The controller advertises the ability to generate PME wakeups from D3
in its PCI capabilities; perhaps we just aren't programming it properly.
I don't see anything in your patch that would set SDHCI wakeup bits or
unmask card insertion/removal IRQs -- maybe that could be it?

Thanks,
