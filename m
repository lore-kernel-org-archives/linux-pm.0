But then we get the problem that user space may echo "on" to the
device's "control" file in sysfs and the whole clever plan basically goes
south.

Moreover, on some systems devices will belong to PM domains and their
drivers may potentially be used with different PM domains on different
platforms.  This means that drivers really should not make any assumptions
about whether or not they can use runtime PM in their system suspend/resume
routines.  They can't.

Now, Kevin, I think that the problem you really want to address is this:
Suppose a driver needs to do one thing in its .runtime_suspend() callback
(e.g. "save state") and it wants to do two things in its .suspend()
callback (e.g. "quiesce device" and "save state").  Then, it seems, the
simplest approach would be to call its .runtie_suspend() routine from
its .suspend() routine (after doing the "quiesce device" thing).

So far, so good, but suppose there's a subsystem, different from the platform
bus type, or a PM domain such that it's not sufficient to call the driver's
.runtime_suspend() alone, because the subsystem-level .runtime_suspend() does
something that's necessary for "really suspending" the device.  Then,
apparently, one can simply call pm_runtime_suspend() from the driver's
.suspend() callback and that will take care of runniung the subsystem-level
.runtime_suspend() too.

Unfortunately, the problem with subsystem-level PM callbacks is that, in
general, the subsystem-level .runtime_suspend() needs to do something slightly
different that the subsystem-level system suspend callbacks.  The reason why is,
more or less, wakeup (plus the fact that hibernate callbacks need not power
down things, which is a detail and I'll ignore it from now on).  More precisely,
the set of wakeup devices for system suspend is determined by user space, while
for runtime PM all devices that can do remote wakeup should be set up to do it.
That's why, in general, the subsystem-level .runtime_suspend() may do wrong
things when it's invoked via the driver's .suspend() routine, during system
suspend.  Apart from this, of course, the subsystem-level .suspend() that
has invoked the driver's .suspend() might already do something that won't
play well with the subsystem-level .runtime_suspend(), if it's called at this
point, or even more likely the subsystem-level .suspend_noirq() that will be
run later may not play well with whatever the subsystem-level .runtime_suspend()
does.

So, we seem to be in a "Catch 22" situation, in which the driver needs to run
its .runtime_suspend() code during system suspend, but it has to do it through
the subsystem-level .runtime_suspend() that cannot be run at that time.
Fortunately, however, there is a way out of it, because the driver has an
option to point its .suspend_noirq() callback to the same routine pointed to
by its .runtime_suspend() and get the subsystem-level .suspend_noirq() to
execute it.  The subsystem-level (e.g. PM domain) callbacks, in turn, may be
designed so that this always works.

Thanks,
Rafael
