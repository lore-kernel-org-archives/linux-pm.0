I'm fine with the idea I think. It's the details I worry about. Which
fields in particular are not updated with this. Are flags?

Also, I'm not too keen on the name; since it explicitly does not modify
the policy and its related parameters, so TUNE_POLICY is actively wrong.

But the thing that confused me most is how fiddled the numbers to fit
this before UTIL_CLAMP.

I'm pretty sure there's a manpage somewhere... SCHED_SETATTR(2) seems to
exist on my machine. So that wants updates.
