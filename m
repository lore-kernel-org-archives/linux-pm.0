Similar criticism to what Rob made on patch 4: this file already says "a
host bridge driver implementation may support the following properties",
so this property is clearly not for child devices. And so having the
"PCI interrupt" here doesn't make much sense.

Similarly, you're documenting "wakeup" here as a host bridge property,
but then patch 7 is adding per-device support it seems? That seems
wrong.

In fact, I'm pretty sure this series fails to actually look in the host
bridge for the "wakeup" interrupt at all! Did you actually test this?

And again, describing your intentions a little better in the commit
message would make this clearer. Then we could tell which way you
intended this to work...
