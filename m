Yes.
is there a reason that would be a problem?

If only 3 characters are useful,
then I'd rather see you simly do this:

#define CPUIDLE_NAME_LEN 3

what "two informations"?
why is kernel bloat the instrument of choice
to avoid the expense of string truncation
in user-space tools?

what two data?

It is fine for a string to include space characters.

they clutter the source code,
they create  an additional name for something
that arguably already has 3 names --
the state #, the name, and the description.
I'd rather delete a few of the fields than add a 4th...

acpi/arch/sh/kernel/cpu/shmobile/cpuidle.c
already uses state->name = "C0", "C1", "C2".

Just use them and be done.

No.

We should not invent an additional abbreviation field.
The tools should use the existing name field.
If the existing name field is not sufficient, then
the states should simply be enumerated and numbers
be shown in the GUI.
