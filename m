Sorry for the delay; I missed this question.  If this has already been
merged somewhere as-is, that's fine.  If you repost it for any reason,
I would prefer to rename it so it reflects the functionality rather
than the source of the information.  This isn't a performance path, so
readability is more important than optimization.
