[ thanks for CCing me, Rafael ]

Agreed. You already have PM callbacks handled properly, so the way this 
should be done is once you're in the PM-callback due to system going 
through power management change, you just stop generation of any new I/O, 
and tell the kthread that it should schedule itself out.

Plus the schedule() has to stay there anyway, as try_to_freeze() is not 
going to provide you with the schedule() semantics unless the system is 
actually undergoing a PM transition towards suspend.

So either semaphore, or some kind of atomic flag, is exactly the 
information that should be passed from the PM callback to the kthread.

(now, I agree, that this is one of the very rare cases where the kthread 
freezer is actually being used properly -- IOW to pause a kthread that is 
actually generating new I/O ... but given the fact that this is so rare, 
and the API is so heavily abused, I really tend to heavily prefer a 
semaphore / flag based aproach).

Thanks,
