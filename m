For devices which don't have a .runtime_idle callback or if it returns
0, rpm_idle will end up in triggering a call to rpm_suspend, thus
trying to carry out a runtime_suspend directly from runtime_idle.

In the above situation we want to respect devices which has enabled
autosuspend, we therfore append the flag sent to rpm_suspend with
RPM_AUTO.

Do note that drivers still needs to update the device last busy mark,
to control the delay for this circumstance.

Updated runtime PM documentation accordingly.
