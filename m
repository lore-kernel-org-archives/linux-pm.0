Thanks, this makes it perfectly clear now. I will try to improve while
communicating.

So we have subsystems, power domains and drivers to consider.

I agree, but I can see why this should be a problem for each and every
driver/bus.

Do note that idea here is only to provide the option of allowing
runtime PM callbacks to be executed as a part of the suspend_late ->
resume_early sequence. It is not a rule, it will have to be decided
for each subsystem/driver it they can benefit from this set up.

That is just a minor important part, but nice to have. Please have
look at the recently submitted patch set, "[PATCH 0/5] PM: Enable
option of re-use runtime PM callbacks at system suspend", I hope the
"cover letter" will describe my intention better.

I am not sure I understand how this will solve my issues (except the
minor "if that device has been runtime suspended, don't touch it" -
thing).

I will still have to have a complex power domain and still
drivers/buses need wrapper functions around their the runtime PM
callbacks to invoke them during system suspend, if they need them.

In my view, I don't think your idea is conflict or can replace what I
suggest. Both can improve the situation, but maybe for different
scenarios.

Kind regards
