I do realize that i did have different opinion given bootloader screw
ups. Given that we have discovered a potentially bad configuration (in
this case for some reason almost ALL TI platforms "have bad
configuration" - could be due to recent clock code changes or what
ever), just killing boot does not make sense to me as purely
bootloader being the cause may not always be the case for that path to
go wrong.
