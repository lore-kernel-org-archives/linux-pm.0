This is an attempt to move a few things out of the port driver.

Patches 1-2 move a workaround for a BIOS PME issue from the port driver to
the PCI core, so it doesn't depend on CONFIG_PCIEPORTBUS.

Patch 3 extends that workaround so it works for Root Complex Event
Collectors.  I haven't seen reports of this being a problem, but I think we
should handle Event Collector PMEs the same as Root Port PMEs.

Patch 4 disables the port driver completely for "pcie_ports=compat".  We
used to register the driver, claim port devices, enable them, etc., as part
of supporting the above BIOS workaround.

Patch 5 removes a port driver link order dependency.

Patch 6 removes the unused VC service.

Patch 7 simplifies the _OSC code path by keeping more of the details in the
ACPI pci_root.c driver.

Patch 8 removes an unnecessary #include.

Patch 9 removes the "pcie_hp=nomsi" parameter.  This was added to work
around an issue when shutting down devices, but a later patch fixed the
root cause, and I don't think we need such a specific parameter any more
(we still have "pci=nomsi").
