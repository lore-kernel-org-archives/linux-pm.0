Right.

An ISR shouldn't call pm_runtime_get_sync() in any case.

You should call pm_runtime_get(), turn off the interrupt source, and
return.  Then your resume routine should check for an outstanding
interrupt or wakeup request and handle it (the easiest way may be 
simply to call the ISR).

You're trying to fight the runtime-PM design instead of using it as it 
was intended.  We already have an API for starting a resume from 
interrupt context, and that's what you should use.
