I hope you are talking about the patch 3/4 for which Arnd also sent a
fix.  I acked it back on 18th of January and Dave has been carrying my
Ack since then. When he posted again, I didn't went into reviewing it
again as I saw my Ack being there.

Yes, he ended up using an API which just got updated after 18th of Jan
and yes both me and Dave missed that. But I feel it is difficult to
take care of scenarios like this. Perhaps he should have made sure
that he base it of pm/linux-next and nothing would have gone wrong.
