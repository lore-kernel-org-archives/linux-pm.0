Here's another option, which is kind of a hybrid of what's been
discussed so far.

The PRCM driver would leave the IRQs enabled during suspend, but would
just delay delivering them to the drivers.  IOW, handle/clear the PRCM
IRQ normally, but delay delivery of the *device* IRQ until the
->complete callback of the PRCM driver.

Doing this ensures all the drivers are resumed before any device IRQ is
delivered, and doesn't require any additional queuing of events in the
drivers.
