The SoC specific voltage domain drivers register with
devm_voltdm_register. the fops provide the abstraction needed for the
SoC (example in patch #5 - which introduces OMAP specific voltage
domain which handles ABB and VDD regulators).

What would you suggest that we do to clarify the usage here?

Yes, that is true, however, there are ways to implement them, for
example: We could implement an higher level clock that takes care of
the multiple clock node control to handle this kind of scenario.

I can elaborate that in the commit message, if that is desirable.

You are correct, I had intended the RFC as purely "OF only". I will
make it independent of of in the next revision.
