It isn't a big thing about the discussion. If these code is only platform code,
we can use gpio or regulator or other thing.

All things are board dependent because we are discussing peripheral
device(not builtin SoC devices), so it is proper to put it in the board file.
If some boards want to share it, we can put it in a single .c file and
let board file include it.

Looks Alan has mentioned, there might be no generic way, and any device's
name change in the path may make the way fragile.

IMO, it isn't necessary to expose these assets to device or users, from the
view of device or user, which only cares two actions(poweron and poweroff)
about the discussed problem. Also it should be better to put these assets
into device resource list, instead of introducing them in 'struct device'.

Looks you associate these assets with ehci-omap device, which mightn't be
enough, because we need to control port's power for supporting port
power off mechanism. Do you have generic way to associate these assets
with usb port device and let port use it generally?

OK, we can include the ULPI PHY clock things easily in ->power_on() and
->power_off() of 'power controller'
