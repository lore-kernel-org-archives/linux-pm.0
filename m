The SDIO card state might be being preserved during hibernation, for
example a SDIO wifi card supporting WOWLAN. That state will be lost if an
SDIO reset is done. One way to avoid that would be to build mmc core as a
module and simply not load it until after attempting to restore the
hibernation image. However that won't work if the hibernation image is
stored on eMMC which, of course, requires mmc core.

It is assumed on such systems that the platform will power cycle the SDIO
card or not as necessary so that the SDIO reset is not needed. Add a
capability flag to reflect that and use it to skip the SDIO reset at scan
time.
