I can't think of any other examples.  But it's possible that more will =

This descripion is very confusing.  You seem to be talking about two
different "power down" operations (one carried out by the driver and
one carried out by the SDIO core), where one of them really does remove
power from the device and the other doesn't.  Or maybe one reduces the
power to an intermediate level and the other reduces it a lot more.  I
can't tell what you actually mean.

To summarize my understanding: After the device was suspended by the
driver, the SDIO core may or may not have powered it off and back on.  =

The driver doesn't know, but it needs to know in order to resume the
device.  Right?

Therefore the problem is that the SDIO core doesn't tell the driver =

when it powers down the device.  That should be easy to fix -- just add =

a flag in a shared structure that can be set when a power-down occurs.

I think it is a bad idea.  It's an attempt to complicate the PM core in =

I don't see why.  Maybe it would help if you explained in more detail
how the driver's runtime_suspend and runtime_resume routines get used.

Or, it may not be as ugly as you think.  Hard for me to tell, without =

knowing how it all hangs together.

The underlying problem seems to be that the driver doesn't know what to
do when it wants to resume the device, because it doesn't know what has
happened while the device was suspended.  To put this another way, the
SDIO core makes significant changes to the device's state without
informing the driver.  This is a self-evident bug.  If the driver was
told what had happened then it could simply do whatever was needed.

It isn't.  The suspend path uses more stack space, since it involves =

calling both the runtime_idle and runtime_suspend routines at each =

step, whereas the resume path calls only the runtime_resume routine.

Sure.

You are overlooking the fact that in our model, runtime suspend and
resume are _not_ symmetric.  The runtime PM model is demand driven; it
wants to keep devices at full power whenever they are needed and allows
them to suspend only when they aren't needed (and hopefully aren't
going to be needed in the near future).  In this model it is imperative
not to delay resumes, but it often is a good idea to delay suspends.  =

That's why, for example, the API includes pm_schedule_suspend() and
pm_runtime_autosuspend() but not pm_schedule_resume() or
pm_runtime_autoresume().  It's also why there is a runtime_idle =

callback but no runtime_needed callback.

Like I said before, it's a trade-off.  There are arguments for both =

sides, and which is better is unclear.  Rafael has to make a judgment =

call.
