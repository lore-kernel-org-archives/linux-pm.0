I don't like this patch and especially adding a new dev_pm_ops flag to
work around something that you're seeing as an issue in the generic ops.

It is sort of like saying "the generic ops don't work for me, so modify
them as well as struct dev_pm_ops", but maybe it's better to change the
PCI bus type to do something different from calling the generic function?

Or you can add a ->complete callback to your driver that will clear
power.direct_complete for the device in question.
