Did you take a look at the most recent patches from Tianyu to add
support to power off a port if a device is suspended?

Start of the series:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-usb&m=135314427413307&w=2
Patch that adds power off on device suspend:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-usb&m=135314431913321&w=2

Tianyu also added some code to the xHCI host controller driver to call
into the ACPI methods to power off a port when the USB hub driver clears
the port power feature.
