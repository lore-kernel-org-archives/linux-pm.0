I didn't manage to find a lot of time to play around with this, but it
definitely looks like the SMM trap is the problem here. I repeated my
pm_trace experiemnts and when it gets stuck it is trying to execute the
_WAK ACPI method which is where the SMM trap happens.

Maybe the SMM code was written with the expectation of a periodic tick
or something like that?
