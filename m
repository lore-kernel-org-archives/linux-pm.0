Hi Brian,

checking the pci-acpi code, it has:
1/ pci_acpi_setup() and pci_acpi_cleanup() to setup/cleanup the 
wakeup(and other stuff) for pci devices

we may need it too(for per-device wake) to parse wake irq and init 
wakeup(false) and maybe setup dedicated wakeirq.

2/ acpi_pci_wakeup(), which would do:
find a parent or root bus or pci dev itself, which can do wakeup, and 
update it's wakeup ability(with a enable_count).

we may need to do something like that, but the can_wakeup() would be 
check if wake irq avaliable, and set_device/bridge_wakeup() would be 
setup/clear dedicated wakeirq, or just call device_set_wakeup_enable()



so maybe we can:
1/ add a setup_root_bus() platform ops callback to parse/setup root 
bus's wakeirq in pci_register_host_bridge(),and clean it in 
pci_stop_bus_device()

2/ add a device_setup() and device_cleanup() callbacks to setup/clean 
pci device's wake irq, and maybe call it in pci_device_probe() or 
pci_setup_device()?

3/ add a can_wakeup() and set_device_wakeup() and set_bridge_wakeup() 
callbacks, and move acpi_pci_wakeup() and acpi_pci_propagate_wakeup()'s 
code and the enable_count code into common platform_pci_set_wakeup().


does this make sense?
