I completely agree. 

We have already proven that the social pressure on crappy applications
works. When NOHZ was merged into the kernel we got no effect at all
because a big percentage of user space applications just used timers
at will and without any thoughts, also it unveiled busy polling and
other horrible coding constructs. So what happened ? Arjan created
powertop which lets the user analyse the worst offenders in his
system. As a result the offending apps got fixed rapidly simply
because no maintainer wanted to be on top of the powertop sh*tlist.

In the mobile app space it's basically the same problem. Users can
influence the app writers simply by voting and setting up public lists
of apps which are crappy or excellent. All it needs is a nice powertop
tool for the phone which allows the users to identify the crap on
their phones. That provides much more incentive - especially for
commercial players - to fix their crappy code.

Adding that sys_try_to_fix_crappy_userspace_code() API to the kernel
is just counter productive as it signals to the app provider: Go
ahead, keep on coding crap!

That's not a solution, that's just capitulation. 

It's absurd that some folks believe that giving up the most efficient
tool to apply pressure to crappy app providers is a good idea.

Thanks,
