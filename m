Hi All,

The PCI bus type and the ACPI PM domain resume runtime-suspended devices during
their .prepare() callbacks, which is suboptimal.

One problem caused by that is increasing the time of system suspend if there
are many runtime-suspended devices to resume during it (because the .prepare()
callbacks are executed sequentially).

The following two patches are intended to improve that one aspect slightly
in those two subsystems.

Thanks!
