I think I found reason for the issue.

When the laptop resumes it will send ACPI BUS_CHECK event for the two
PCIe root ports. This ends up in acpiphp_check_bridge() where it goes
through all slots in that bridge checking if the devices are still
present. This happens before we call pci_scan_bridge() for the bridge
itself.

Since the bridge is in D3 config space of the device behind it is not
available and we determine that the device is not there anymore.

It looks like we either need that ACPI hotplug patch or alternatively we
could add pm_runtime_get/put() in acpiphp_check_bridge().
