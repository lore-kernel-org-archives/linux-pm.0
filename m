Hh, I do not see that orderly_poweroff() will wait for anything now:
void orderly_poweroff(bool force)
{
	if (force) /* do not override the pending "true" */
		poweroff_force = true;
	schedule_work(&poweroff_work); 
^^^^^^^ async call. even here can be pretty big delay if system is under pressure
}


static int __orderly_poweroff(bool force)
{
	int ret;

	ret = run_cmd(poweroff_cmd);
^^^^ no wait for the process - only for exec. flags == UMH_WAIT_EXEC

	if (ret && force) {
		pr_warn("Failed to start orderly shutdown: forcing the issue\n");

		/*
		 * I guess this should try to kick off some daemon to sync and
		 * poweroff asap.  Or not even bother syncing if we're doing an
		 * emergency shutdown?
		 */
		emergency_sync();
		kernel_power_off();
^^^ force power off, but only if run_cmd() failed - for example /sbin/poweroff doesn't exist
	}

	return ret;
}

static bool poweroff_force;

static void poweroff_work_func(struct work_struct *work)
{
	__orderly_poweroff(poweroff_force);
}

As result thermal has no control of power off any more after calling orderly_poweroff() and can get the result
of US poweroff binary execution.
