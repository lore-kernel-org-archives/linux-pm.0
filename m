Well, not really.  This doesn't work in general, because the assumptions for
running .suspend() (at any time, with user space frozen) are quite different
from the assumptions for running .runtime_suspend() (when the device is not
in use).  So generally .suspend() and .runtime_suspend() should be different.

That said .runtime_suspend() generally can be the same as .suspend_late()
(and that was the main reason why the latter was introduced in the first
place) and analogously for .runtime_resume() and .reasume_early().

Although there are simple cases in which .suspend() and .runtime_suspend() may
be the same, I'd still recommend to point .suspend_late and .runtime_suspend
to the same routine and leaving .suspend as NULL in those cases too (and
analogously for the resume stuff).

Thanks,
Rafael
