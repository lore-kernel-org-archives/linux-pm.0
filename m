Mobile folks wish to power down some devices (most often input -
touchscreen, keypad) under certain circumstances to save power.
So far they were doing that by adding "disable" hook to individual
drivers and while I did allow that in for some devices I feel that we
need more standardised solution, preferably one that could re-use
existing PM hooks in drivers.
