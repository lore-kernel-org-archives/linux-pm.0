Wasn't that /sys/devices/.../power/wakeup rather?

I don't think this is what we discussed then really.

There is a fundamental problem with forcing things into runtime suspend
from user space, because that may happen in a wrong time.  In other words,
the kernel can't guarantee that the device would actually be able to go
into runtime suspend when requested.
