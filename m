That's correct, but to me the Arve's goal is simply to maximize battery life
and he found experimentally that the longest battery life is achieved if
system suspend is used whenever the system doesn't need to be active (from its
user's perspective).  This actually is different from "when the system is
idle", because the system isn't idle, for example, when updatedb is running.
However, from the user's perspective the updatedb process doesn't really need
to run at this particular time, it can very well do it's job in parallel with
the user typing or reading news.  So, the system may very well be suspended
when updatedb is running.

Now, "when the system doesn't need to be active" is not a very precise
statement, so the Android people attempted to develop a mechanism allowing
them to specify what that means more precisely.  It works for them, it need not
work for everyone, though.  Of course, we can dismiss it as "crap", "broken
design", whatever, but then we need to give them a clear advice what to do
to achieve the same goal (maximum battery life) in a different way that would
be more acceptable to us.

Since I think we've now rejected the feature, do we have a clear picture about
what the Android people should do _instead_ and yet keep the battery life they
want?  Because I don't think telling "let them do what they want, who cares"
is right.

Thanks,
Rafael
