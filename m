Yes, it will *IF* userspace fails. the condition that I had tracked
was before identifying the following fix[1] - Example fail is here[2]

In this case, tmp102 is setup for X15 as [3] - and built as a module.
as the kernel startsup filesystem and starts a modprobe of all modules
via udev rules, the probe of tmp102 detects (falsely) a critical
temperature condition. Shutdown attempt in the middle of driver probe
is always a tricky business.

As we look at the log in [2], Line  472
> thermal thermal_zone3: critical temperature reached(108 C),shutting down
We have userspace trigger for shutdown taking place.

Line 495: INIT: Sending processes the TERM signal

userspace starts shutting down services. (but note that probe for
other devices were either in progress or queued up to complete)..

at line 647 - we are in a weird place -> sysrq shows that system is
idled and userspace is shutdown and system is still active.


In this case, we entered the case thanks to a driver bug, but if this
situation was a real world temperature scenario, then we'd probably in
an overtemp scenario, then device damage could take place OR something
much worse.

The only alternative is to run a parallel thread in case userspace
fails to complete the job in some given period of time - due to what
ever be the condition triggering the problem.

I hope this explains the problem.
