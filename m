All the snd_soc_dapm_new_widgets() related reads go missing
without the .read being there. Probably the same story for
writes.

Hmm these calls are in sound/soc/soc-core.c though? But yeah, sure
it could be some legacy code issue somewhere..

Based on a quick grep these have .read and .write removed in next
so they may all be broken now:

sound/soc/codecs/cx20442.c
sound/soc/codecs/tlv320dac33.c
sound/soc/codecs/twl4030.c
sound/soc/codecs/twl6040.c
sound/soc/codecs/uda1380.c
sound/soc/fsl/fsl_ssi.c

Can you confirm that some of these are still working?

Regards,

Tony
