Normally they would be the same.  But even if they aren't, someone has 
violated the kernel interface: The first user told the kernel a 
particular device wasn't going to be used, and then the second user 
tried to use it.

Of course, this issue doesn't arise for devices that merely report 
external events.

Should the mechanism really be per-device?  Or would it be more useful 
to have a single "inhibit" setting that affected all the relevant 
devices at once?

The runtime-PM "usage" value for these devices is a little tricky to 
calculate.  It should be nonzero if there are any open files _and_ the 
device isn't "inhibited".  I don't know the best way to represent that 
kind of condition in the runtime PM framework.
