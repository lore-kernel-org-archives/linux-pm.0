Hi Linus,

Please pull from

 git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rafael/linux-pm.git \
 pm+acpi-4.4-rc1-1

to receive the first batch of power management and ACPI updates for
v4.4-rc1 with top-most commit 1ab68460b1d0671968b35e04f21efcf1ce051916

 Merge branches 'pm-avs', 'pm-clk' and 'powercap'

on top of commit 32b88194f71d6ae7768a29f87fbba454728273ee

 Linux 4.3-rc7

Quite a new features are included this time.

First off, the Collaborative Processor Performance Control interface
(version 2) defined by ACPI will now be supported on ARM64 along
with a cpufreq frontend for CPU performance scaling.

Second, ACPI gets a new infrastructure for the early probing of
IRQ chips and clock sources (along the lines of the existing
similar mechanism for DT).

Next, the ACPI core and the generic device properties API will
now support a recently introduced hierarchical properties
extension of the _DSD (Device Specific Data) ACPI device
configuration object.  If the ACPI platform firmware uses
that extension to organize device properties in a hierarchical
way, the kernel will automatically handle it and make those
properties available to device drivers via the generic device
properties API.

It also will be possible to build the ACPICA's AML interpreter
debugger into the kernel now and use that to diagnose AML-related
problems more efficiently.  In the future, this should make it
possible to single-step AML execution and do similar things.
Interesting stuff, although somewhat experimental at this point.

Finally, the PM core gets a new mechanism that can be used by
device drivers to distinguish between suspend-to-RAM (based on
platform firmware support) and suspend-to-idle (or other variants
of system suspend the platform firmware is not involved in) and
possibly optimize their device suspend/resume handling accordingly.

In addition to that, some existing features are re-organized
quite substantially.

First, the ACPI-based handling of PCI host bridges on x86 and ia64
is unified and the common code goes into the ACPI core (so as to
reduce code duplication and eliminate non-essential differences
between the two architectures in that area).

Second, the Operating Performance Points (OPP) framework is
reorganized to make the code easier to find and follow.

Next, the cpufreq core's sysfs interface is reorganized to
get rid of the "primary CPU" concept for configurations in
which the same performance scaling settings are shared
between multiple CPUs.

Finally, some interfaces that aren't necessary any more are
dropped from the generic power domains framework.

On top of the above we have some minor extensions, cleanups
and bug fixes in multiple places, as usual.

Specifics:

 - ACPICA update to upstream revision 20150930 (Bob Moore, Lv Zheng).

   The most significant change is to allow the AML debugger to be
   built into the kernel.  On top of that there is an update related
   to the NFIT table (the ACPI persistent memory interface)
   and a few fixes and cleanups.

 - ACPI CPPC2 (Collaborative Processor Performance Control v2)
   support along with a cpufreq frontend (Ashwin Chaugule).

   This can only be enabled on ARM64 at this point.

 - New ACPI infrastructure for the early probing of IRQ chips and
   clock sources (Marc Zyngier).

 - Support for a new hierarchical properties extension of the ACPI
   _DSD (Device Specific Data) device configuration object allowing
   the kernel to handle hierarchical properties (provided by the
   platform firmware this way) automatically and make them available
   to device drivers via the generic device properties interface
   (Rafael Wysocki).

 - Generic device properties API extension to obtain an index of
   certain string value in an array of strings, along the lines of
   of_property_match_string(), but working for all of the supported
   firmware node types, and support for the "dma-names" device
   property based on it (Mika Westerberg).

 - ACPI core fix to parse the MADT (Multiple APIC Description Table)
   entries in the order expected by platform firmware (and mandated
   by the specification) to avoid confusion on systems with more than
   255 logical CPUs (Lukasz Anaczkowski).

 - Consolidation of the ACPI-based handling of PCI host bridges
   on x86 and ia64 (Jiang Liu).

 - ACPI core fixes to ensure that the correct IRQ number is used to
   represent the SCI (System Control Interrupt) in the cases when
   it has been re-mapped (Chen Yu).

 - New ACPI backlight quirk for Lenovo IdeaPad S405 (Hans de Goede).

 - ACPI EC driver fixes (Lv Zheng).

 - Assorted ACPI fixes and cleanups (Dan Carpenter, Insu Yun, Jiri
   Kosina, Rami Rosen, Rasmus Villemoes).

 - New mechanism in the PM core allowing drivers to check if the
   platform firmware is going to be involved in the upcoming system
   suspend or if it has been involved in the suspend the system is
   resuming from at the moment (Rafael Wysocki).

   This should allow drivers to optimize their suspend/resume
   handling in some cases and the changes include a couple of users
   of it (the i8042 input driver, PCI PM).

 - PCI PM fix to prevent runtime-suspended devices with PME enabled
   from being resumed during system suspend even if they aren't
   configured to wake up the system from sleep (Rafael Wysocki).

 - New mechanism to report the number of a wakeup IRQ that woke up
   the system from sleep last time (Alexandra Yates).

 - Removal of unused interfaces from the generic power domains
   framework and fixes related to latency measurements in that
   code (Ulf Hansson, Daniel Lezcano).

 - cpufreq core sysfs interface rework to make it handle CPUs that
   share performance scaling settings (represented by a common
   cpufreq policy object) more symmetrically (Viresh Kumar).

   This should help to simplify the CPU offline/online handling among
   other things.

 - cpufreq core fixes and cleanups (Viresh Kumar).

 - intel_pstate fixes related to the Turbo Activation Ratio (TAR)
   mechanism on client platforms which causes the turbo P-states
   range to vary depending on platform firmware settings (Srinivas
   Pandruvada).

 - intel_pstate sysfs interface fix (Prarit Bhargava).

 - Assorted cpufreq driver (imx, tegra20, powernv, integrator) fixes
   and cleanups (Bai Ping, Bartlomiej Zolnierkiewicz, Shilpasri G
   Bhat, Luis de Bethencourt).

 - cpuidle mvebu driver cleanups (Russell King).

 - OPP (Operating Performance Points) framework code reorganization
   to make it more maintainable (Viresh Kumar).

 - Intel Broxton support for the RAPL (Running Average Power Limits)
   power capping driver (Amy Wiles).

 - Assorted power management code fixes and cleanups (Dan Carpenter,
   Geert Uytterhoeven, Geliang Tang, Luis de Bethencourt, Rasmus
   Villemoes).

Thanks!


PS
Please note that commit

  3722ed2380ad ("clocksource: cosmetic: Drop OF 'dependency' from symbols")

included here will clash with commit

  9821e545c5e0 ("ARM: mediatek: enable gpt6 on boot up to make arch
timer working")

leading to a build failure that may be addressed by the appended patch from
Stephen Rothwell.
