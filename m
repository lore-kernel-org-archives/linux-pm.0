That suggestion doesn't seem to be correct because there's another
value besides PCI_D3cold which is also greater than PCI_D3hot,
namely PCI_UNKNOWN. (If the device is in that state, e.g. after
pci_device_remove() has been called, and the system goes to sleep,
we'd leave the device as is and not put it into D3hot as we do now.)

I will update this patch with Bjorn's suggestion to also leave the
device in D3cold if it is wakeup-capable. The idea is to just change
the default state in the first line of the function like this:

-	pci_power_t target_state = PCI_D3hot;
+	pci_power_t target_state =
+		dev->current_state == PCI_D3cold ? PCI_D3cold : PCI_D3hot;

Thanks,

Lukas
