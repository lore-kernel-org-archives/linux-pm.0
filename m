Yes, it would, but that might prevent some systems from suspending at
all in theory if there are keyboard interrupts on them occurring
during system-wide suspend, for example.

Otherwise, it would just be a matter of calling device_wakeup_enable()
at init time for the keyboard port (as long as you know which one of
them is the keyboard).
