Hello,

We're using the Linux cgroup Freezer on some machines that use NFS and
have run into what appears to be a bug where frozen tasks are blocking
running tasks and preventing them from completing.  On one of our
machines which happens to be running an older 3.10.46 kernel we have
frozen some of the tasks on the system using the cgroup Freezer.  We
also have a separate set of tasks which are NOT frozen which are stuck
trying to open some files on NFS.

Looking at the frozen tasks there are several that have the following
stack:

[<ffffffff814fd055>] rpc_wait_bit_killable+0x35/0x80
[<ffffffff814fd01d>] __rpc_wait_for_completion_task+0x2d/0x30
[<ffffffff811dce5d>] nfs4_run_open_task+0x11d/0x170
[<ffffffff811de7a3>] _nfs4_open_and_get_state+0x53/0x260
[<ffffffff811e12d1>] nfs4_do_open+0x121/0x400
[<ffffffff811e15e1>] nfs4_atomic_open+0x31/0x50
[<ffffffff811f02dc>] nfs4_file_open+0xac/0x180
[<ffffffff811479be>] do_dentry_open.isra.19+0x1ee/0x280
[<ffffffff81147b3e>] finish_open+0x1e/0x30
[<ffffffff811578d2>] do_last.isra.64+0x2c2/0xc40
[<ffffffff81158519>] path_openat.isra.65+0x2c9/0x490
[<ffffffff81158c38>] do_filp_open+0x38/0x80
[<ffffffff81148cd4>] do_sys_open+0xe4/0x1c0
[<ffffffff81148dce>] SyS_open+0x1e/0x20
[<ffffffff8153e719>] system_call_fastpath+0x16/0x1b
[<ffffffffffffffff>] 0xffffffffffffffff

Here it looks like we are waiting in a wait queue inside
rpc_wait_bit_killable() for RPC_TASK_ACTIVE.

And there is a single task with a stack that looks like the following:

[<ffffffff8107dc05>] __refrigerator+0x55/0x150
[<ffffffff814fd086>] rpc_wait_bit_killable+0x66/0x80
[<ffffffff814fd01d>] __rpc_wait_for_completion_task+0x2d/0x30
[<ffffffff811dce5d>] nfs4_run_open_task+0x11d/0x170
[<ffffffff811de7a3>] _nfs4_open_and_get_state+0x53/0x260
[<ffffffff811e12d1>] nfs4_do_open+0x121/0x400
[<ffffffff811e15e1>] nfs4_atomic_open+0x31/0x50
[<ffffffff811f02dc>] nfs4_file_open+0xac/0x180
[<ffffffff811479be>] do_dentry_open.isra.19+0x1ee/0x280
[<ffffffff81147b3e>] finish_open+0x1e/0x30
[<ffffffff811578d2>] do_last.isra.64+0x2c2/0xc40
[<ffffffff81158519>] path_openat.isra.65+0x2c9/0x490
[<ffffffff81158c38>] do_filp_open+0x38/0x80
[<ffffffff81148cd4>] do_sys_open+0xe4/0x1c0
[<ffffffff81148dce>] SyS_open+0x1e/0x20
[<ffffffff8153e719>] system_call_fastpath+0x16/0x1b
[<ffffffffffffffff>] 0xffffffffffffffff

This looks similar but the different offset into
rpc_wait_bit_killable() shows that we have returned from the
schedule() call in freezable_schedule() and are now blocked in
__refrigerator() inside freezer_count()

Similarly if you look at the tasks that are NOT frozen but are stuck
opening a NFS file, they also have the following stack showing they are
waiting in the wait queue for RPC_TASK_ACTIVE.

[<ffffffff814fd055>] rpc_wait_bit_killable+0x35/0x80
[<ffffffff814fd01d>] __rpc_wait_for_completion_task+0x2d/0x30
[<ffffffff811dce5d>] nfs4_run_open_task+0x11d/0x170
[<ffffffff811de7a3>] _nfs4_open_and_get_state+0x53/0x260
[<ffffffff811e12d1>] nfs4_do_open+0x121/0x400
[<ffffffff811e15e1>] nfs4_atomic_open+0x31/0x50
[<ffffffff811f02dc>] nfs4_file_open+0xac/0x180
[<ffffffff811479be>] do_dentry_open.isra.19+0x1ee/0x280
[<ffffffff81147b3e>] finish_open+0x1e/0x30
[<ffffffff811578d2>] do_last.isra.64+0x2c2/0xc40
[<ffffffff81158519>] path_openat.isra.65+0x2c9/0x490
[<ffffffff81158c38>] do_filp_open+0x38/0x80
[<ffffffff81148cd4>] do_sys_open+0xe4/0x1c0
[<ffffffff81148dce>] SyS_open+0x1e/0x20
[<ffffffff8153e719>] system_call_fastpath+0x16/0x1b
[<ffffffffffffffff>] 0xffffffffffffffff

We have hit this a couple of times now and know that if we THAW all of
the frozen tasks that running tasks will unwedge and finish.

Additionally we have also tried thawing the single task that is frozen
in __refrigerator() inside rpc_wait_bit_killable().  This usually
results in different frozen task entering the __refrigerator() state
inside rpc_wait_bit_killable().  It looks like each one of those tasks
must wake up another letting it progress.  Again if you thaw enough of
the frozen tasks eventually everything unwedges and everything
completes.

I've looked through the 3.10 stable patches since 3.10.46 and don't
see anything that looks like it addresses this.  Does anyone have any
idea what might be going on here, and what the fix might be?

Thanks,
Shawn
