I am really not questioning the autosuspend feature at all, it's a
really great feature!

Now, I question the minor benefit we actually gain from having the
runtime PM core to update the mark in rpm_resume().

To me, the best decision when to update the mark is know by the
driver/subsystem for the device and not the core.

In most cases the mark will be updated after a request has been
completed, which leads to one unnecessary update at rpm_resume().

In this path (the resume), you really want to keep latencies to a
minimum and for sure not do unnecessary things.

That's not always going to work.

Sometimes you need to access the device when trying to probe. Failing
later in probe, shows just *one* case where it doesn't make sense to
update the last busy mark. I suspect there may be other cases as well.

Of course one can always use runtime PM APIs which overrides the
autosuspend mode, so it's not a big deal.

Kind regards
