First of all, the direct_complete flag is marked "Owned by the PM core"
in include/linux/pm.h. So I would have expected that a driver is not
supposed to fudge it.

Second, yes it's possible to make it work by clearing direct_complete
in the ->complete callback, but there's a catch: The device tree is
traversed bottom-up in dpm_complete(). Recall that a Thunderbolt
controller consists of multiple devices and that power control is
governed by its top-most device (upstream bridge). But because we're
going bottom-up, clearing the direct_complete flag must be done by
the bottom-most device (NHI)! So I've got all the power management
stuff nicely separated in functions executed for the upstream bridge,
but a small portion needs to be executed for the NHI. That's ugly.

Normally the device hierarchy is traversed bottom-up during suspend
and top-down during resume. However ->prepare and ->complete do it
the other way round. In the case of ->prepare, this is even documented
in Documentation/power/devices.txt but the reason thereof is not.
Could you explain this please?

Third, I'm irritated by your question "maybe it's better to change the
PCI bus type to do something different from calling the generic function".
What should that be? Under which circumstances can we leave a PCI device
asleep after direct-complete?

I'm generally irritated by commit 58a1fbbb2ee8, it's a significant change
to mandatorily wake all devices, it wastes a not insignificant amount of
energy, yet the reasoning in the commit message sounds vague and handwavy
("There is a concern [...] devices that are most likely to be affected").

Are there clear indications for or against a device requiring a resume?
E.g. the commit message names SoCs, perhaps those can be recognized by
having child devices of certain types?

Thanks,

Lukas
