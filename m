The PM control register is not accessible in D3cold so we shouldn't try
writing to it in pci_raw_set_power_state() and return an error instead.

The current behaviour is fatal for devices which are not power-managed
by the platform, yet can be runtime suspended to D3cold with some other
mechanism by the driver:

- When the device is runtime resumed, pci_pm_runtime_resume() first
  calls pci_restore_standard_config() which calls pci_set_power_state()
  which calls pci_raw_set_power_state() to put the device into D0.
  This fails since the device is still in D3cold.  It will be powered up
  later on when pci_pm_runtime_resume() calls the driver's
  ->runtime_resume callback.

- pci_raw_set_power_state() prints a message that the device refused to
  change power state and returns 0.  Further up in the call stack,
  pci_restore_standard_config() calls pci_restore_state(), which fails
  since the device is in D3cold, but nevertheless invalidates the
  saved_state.

- When pci_pm_runtime_resume() finally calls the driver ->runtime_resume
  callback to power up the device, the saved_state is gone.

Return an error from pci_raw_set_power_state() to avoid this.

An example for devices affected by this are Thunderbolt controllers
built into Macs which can be put into D3cold with nonstandard ACPI
methods.

Unfortunately we rely on pci_raw_set_power_state()'s current behaviour
in several places: When platform_pci_set_power_state() is called to wake
a device from D3cold, its current_state is not updated even though it is
no longer in D3cold.  Instead, pci_raw_set_power_state() is assumed to
clean up the resulting incongruence.  Fix by setting current_state to
PCI_UNKNOWN after platform_pci_set_power_state().

Also, when a bridge is put into D3cold, its children's current_state is
changed to D3cold in __pci_complete_power_transition().  (Introduced by
commit 448bd857d48e ("PCI/PM: add PCIe runtime D3cold support").) This
doesn't necessarily reflect the children's actual power state: They may
still be powered on, they're just no longer accessible.  However this
shouldn't be a concern because if the children are accessed, their
parent needs to resume anyway and the PM core takes care of this.
Again, pci_raw_set_power_state() is relied upon to clean up the
current_state when the children are resumed the next time.  We cannot
reliably reconstruct the children's current_state when resuming their
parent.  We also shouldn't blindly set it to PCI_UNKNOWN since some
children may actually be turned off and D3cold is their correct
current_state.  Therefore fix by no longer touching the children's
current_state at all.
