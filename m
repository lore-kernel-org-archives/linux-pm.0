That's OK. :-)

It just means I need to move that logic up to the concerned middle layers.

I was going to do that to start with, but then I thought I would do it in
the core to avoid duplicated checks.  I overlooked the genpd case, however.

Yes, that should be fine if the logic above goes to the PCI bus type
and ACPI PM domain.  Then, setting the flag will have no effect on
genpd at all, but that's OK.

Thanks,
