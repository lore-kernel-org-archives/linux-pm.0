I was actually thinking about the other direction: moving the get_sync
after the first notifier chain.  IOW, the get_sync/put_sync only
protects the ->remove() calls, not the notifiers.

The protection around the notifiers doesn't make sense to me, at least
in the context of driver runtime PM racing with the subsystem.
Especially since these notifiers are likely how the
subsystem/bus/pm_domain code getting notified that there may be a device
to manage in the first place.
