Yeah, but a user can't say: "I don't
know programming, but I had this idea. Here try it out." 
to his friend. Because his friends phone then will crap out.

This is a negative. The phone just doesn't work well. 

A knowledgeable programmer is able to do extra work to enable specific
guarantees. A dummy-throw-away-programmer doesn't want to do
any extra work.

I don't think this is a defect in the approach but the point of it.

This is true. Nonetheless, in my opinion, implementing the "backwards
approach" in any form (suspend blockers or some other sort of "sane"
interface) is necessary in the long run.  I also believe that Alan's
approach is the more flexible one. But I'm not in a position to judge
on this.

If it really is better and superior, I think userland will switch
over to it, as soon as it is possible to do it. The impact to the
drivers code is needed anyway. What looses the kernel by implementing
suspend blockers, and later a more finegrained approach and mapping the
userspace part of suspend blockers on that finegrained approach later
on?

I liked this idea of Arjan, to give some applications infinite timer
slack. But I don't know if it can made work in a "dummy proof" way.
(I.e. it is too complicated to get it right in general, except for the
"infinity" or not kind of tuning)

Doesn't solve the segregation problem and is probably overkill for most
applications. I see this as an orthogonal thing (i.e. not
affecting this merge).

I can't really say anything against that. Or anything in favor of it.  
Except that this is probably a really hard decision for Linus to
make.

Maybe. It is something which seems to not come from the traditional
"linux distribution" model of software deployment, where you have a
party that codes and another party that packages that code. 

It instead is more targeted at the decentralised 3rd-party-app
approach under which windows is suffering.

True. But I wouldnt say, that it is the linux kernel who should force
this politics onto its users.
