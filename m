I have no intention for this to become common. For the 2+ years tracepoints have 
been upstream this is the first time it has come up. It's a rare occurance, and as 
long as we keep it rare and as long as we have a smooth transition process in place 
it should be good. If it becomes common we are doing something wrong ...

Alternatively you might want to review the new power events and suggest ways to add 
that extra information to existing events that suits your purposes as well. You 
added the old power tracepoints so you sure must have an opinion about it all?

Thanks,
