Hi Rafael,

Thanks for the responses, and sorry for some delay. My thoughts are
still a bit scattered on this (and I'm also busy with other things), and
I'd like some feedback on the device tree definitions from someone, if
possible. (I expect you're more familiar with ACPI than with device
tree, but perhaps you or someone else on copy can humor me?)

I'm also not sure I agree with all of your suggestions, though maybe
something "similar" could be OK.

Sure. It does seem like a bit of overkill, on second thought.

Sure, arbitrary hierarchy is probably over-engineering. But 1-per-device
is quite reasonable -- even if we don't support it immediately, it would
be nice if it can be added without too much trouble.

So, *don't* define the wakeup in the host bridge?

Or put another way: how would you define a DT description for this?

By the way, it seems pretty ambiguous how we want to handle things like
(a) multiple devices sharing the same WAKE#
(b) systems where a slot is swappable

For (a), the main problem is that if we have to repeat the interrupt
definition in multiple devices, then we have to deal with something like
IRQF_SHARED. That can be done, but it makes it much harder to use the
dedicated wakeirq helpers.

For (b), it's already weird to write device trees for probable PCI
devices; you technically need to redefine the node for the PCI ID of
each device that gets plugged in. So instead, it seems more like maybe
a property of the port?

Or more concretely:

pcie@XXXXXXXX {
	compatible = "rockchip,rk3399-pcie";
	interrupts-extended = ..., <&gpioX Y>;  // the existing
						// proposal, for
						// 'wakeup' in the host
						// bridge
	interrupt-names = ..., "wakeup";

	pcie_port: pcie@0,0 {
		...
		/*
		// This is a possible proposal, to account for (b)?
		interrupts = <Y>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpioX>;
		interrupt-names = "wakeup";
		*/

		wifi_device: wifi@0,0 {
			compatible = "pci11ab,2b42";
			/*
			// This is the "1-per-device" proposal?
			// But it doesn't work well if the PCI ID
			// changes (e.g., card swap). Probably want to
			// avoid this if possible.
			// Also, it has an awkward conflict with INTx
			// definitions.
			interrupts-extended = <&intX 0>, <&gpioX Y>;
			interrupt-names = "pci", "wakeup";
			*/
			...
		};
	};
};

Does the description at the "port" level seem reasonable? We'd still
have to figure out how to parse this properly of course...

Hmm, that does seem a little weird, but I believe maybe Jeffy is using
it as a hack for fitting in with the "dedicated IRQ" stuff? It seems
more like you should be able to use something like
dev_pm_enable_wake_irq() / dev_pm_disable_wake_irq() instead though.
That's a question for patch 7 though, not for the general architecture
of these hooks -- we want to do *something* the arm/disarm the wake-IRQ
there.

Yes, that's technically the only essential thing needed, though it does
make things a little tougher. We still may need to (depending on whether
we decide to define WAKE# in the bridge, the port, or the device) do
some hierarchy walking. I'm also not yet convinced about "where to
initialize" (see comments below).

Right.

Well, the global 'platform_notify' and 'platform_notify_remove'
singletons seem even more fragile. Do we really want to take over the
whole system's device registration hooks just to handle something for a
particular bus type? We're not going to be able to write a generic "add"
and "remove" hook for all devices on all Device Tree systems for this
type of feature. It would likely break a lot of sub-devices to start
parsing "wakeup" properties there.

We *could* do something like what it8152 does:

static int it8152_pci_platform_notify(struct device *dev)
{
	if (dev_is_pci(dev)) {
	...
	}
	return 0;
}

but that doesn't look very nice to me. Among other problems, it won't
stack nicely. What if an 'it8152' system wants to use this 'wakeup'
interrupt definition too?

Instead, I think it makes perfect sense to put the DT-centric wakeup
handling all in the same module -- the "Firmware PM callbacks" (struct
pci_platform_pm_ops) -- instead of scattering it around the codebase.

I don't like that solution, per the above. (Depending on what "or maybe
something similar" means.)

Yes, but that's what these hooks were allowing; PCI PM firmware hooks
get a chance to do enumeration-time initialization for both bridges and
devices.
