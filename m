Right, effective is always tracking the bucket we refcounted at
enqueue time.

We can still argue that, the moment we change a clamp, a task should
be updated without waiting for a dequeue/enqueue cycle.

IMO, that could be a limitation only for tasks which never sleep, but
that's a very special case.

Instead, as you'll see, in the cgroup integration we force update all
RUNNABLE tasks. Although that's expensive, since we are in the domain
of the "delegation model" and "containers resources control", there
it's probably more worth to pay than here.

Cool, so... I'll keep lazy update for system default.
