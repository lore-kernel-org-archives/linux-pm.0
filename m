Hey, Michal.

The operation of looking at one's parent and inherting the state.
Here, checking parent->state and calling apply_state accordingly.

I'm worried that this is a bit too subtle.  This will work fine with a
single hierarchy mutex protecting hierarchy updates and state
propagations through it and that should work for most controllers too.
I want to have at least one example of finer grained locking for
future reference and cgroup_freezer happened to be the one I started
working on.  So, it is more complicated (not necessarily in written
code but the sync rules) than necessary.  I'm still not sure whether
to keep it or not.  I'll add more documentation about synchronization
in cgroup_for_each_descendant_pre() either way.

Thanks.
