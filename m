Let me put this a different way.

Would you be upset if you installed a new kernel, rebooted and found that
the system then fscked your filesystem, stamping a date of 1 Jan 1970
on it.  Then you use a later dtb, and you have to go through another
fsck of your filesystem because it's apparently been more than "31 days"
or so since it was last fscked, and all this caused by the RTC vanishing
because we couldn't be bothered with backward compatibility?

There are real products out there which use iMX6 today.  In production,
being sold.

Do not break existing DTBs unless there really is no other choice.

And I don't think it makes the code ugly, though it does make it _slightly_
more complex.  That's a price worth paying for keeping stuff working.
