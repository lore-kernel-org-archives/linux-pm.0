Almost: due to a lack of firmware support I hacked the efi stub to read a 'seed'
from a system counter.

To check it works I printed the address of 'panic' out during boot:
> [    0.353712] DEBUG: &panic == ffffff960819a4e8

Then hibernated, and powered the board back on, the resume kernel gives:
> [    0.353528] DEBUG: &panic == ffffff840819a4e8

But after it has restored the hibernate image, I can dig in /proc/kallsyms to
see the original value:
> root@localhost:~# cat /proc/kallsyms  | grep "T panic"
> ffffff960819a4e8 T panic

Looks good to me.


Thanks,
