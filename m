Sufficently beneficial to justify putting all this stuff all over the
kernel and apps ? That is a *very* high hurdle, doubly so when those
vendors who have chosen to be part of the community are shipping phones
and PDAs just fine without them.

This assumes you modify all the applications. That isn't going to happen.
The hardware is going to catch up anyway.

How do you know that isn't the correct behavior. My laptop behaves in
that way if for example the battery is almost flat. Your suspend blocker
would cause me to lose all my work with a flat battery. This is another
example of why the application must not be the policy manager.

In the normal case in the PC world outside of corner cases like flat
batteries the answer is really simple. The laptop suspend to RAM
on idle intervals set in the BIOS and the like are sufficient that
progress will have been made before it considers going back to sleep
again. Right now its about ten seconds in each direction plus other costs
(wear on LCD backlight, disc parking etc).
