As I have stated earlier, this isn't going to solve the general case,
as the above change log seems to state. I think we really need to do
that, before adding yet another system suspend/resume optimization
path in the PM core.

The main reason is that lots of drivers have additional operations to
perform, besides making sure that its device is put into a "runtime
suspended state" during system suspend. In other words, skipping
system suspend callbacks (and likewise for system resume) is to me the
wrong solution to mitigate these problems.

Certainly there are drivers that could start to deploying this
solution, because at the moment they don't have any additional
operations to perform at system suspend. But what about the rest,
don't we care about them?

Moreover, what happens when/if a driver that has deployed this
solution, starts being used on a new SoC and then additional
operations during system suspend becomes required (for example
pinctrls that needs to be put in a system sleep state)? Then
everything falls apart, doesn't it?

Kind regards
