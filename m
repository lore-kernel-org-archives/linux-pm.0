This line is a little unclear, especially since there *is* an old
documented standard, yet the following text is actually introducing new,
non-standard additions.

IMO, since you're trying to augment a standardized binding, you need to
be a lot clearer here. I expect you should mention the existing standard
(that devices may optionally include an 'interrupts' property that
represents the legacy PCI interrupt) and how you're augmenting it (that
additional interrupts can be supported optionally, but they require a
corresponding 'interrupt-names' property).

Also, is this binding only applying either to a host bridge or to
devices? No intermediate bridges or ports? It seems so, but I wanted to
be clear. (And it probably could be extended if needed. Notably, ACPI
has a tree-walk implementation, so if the device itself doesn't have
a wakeup config, it can look into any of its parents.)

Once you fix up the documentation...I suppose this looks like a sane
idea. But I'd like 2nd opinions on this.
