'Fact of life' isn't a useful reasoning basis. It tells me nothing about
how you got to that pronouncement.

See above. You can't always abort the suspend you may have to go full
circle. Not only that but the exactly algorithm above can be applied
user to kernel as well as kernel to hardware.

Given your average app author I think I'd rather just run their suspend
then their resume handling back to back anyway because it's a single
tested code path, while half way through cases in apps will *never* get
tested or work properly.

So I guess if you are driving this rom user space (which I take it you
are given you talk about housekeeping)

	foreach app we need to suspend
		kick app to suspend (signal)
		(policy) kick harder if needed (SIGSTOP/bitch/shall I
					kill it dialogue)
	rendezvous (apps now all sleeping or dead)

X
	if (we still want to suspend) {
		prod kernel
		kernel suspends
		kernel resumes
	}
	resume all the apps


The important msising bit from that is 'set wake flags'.

Now what actually happens here beyond point X. Any event that gets kernel
processed moves the task into RUNNING. Any event that occurs after that
point causes the hardware to go suspend/resume. If not the driver is
buggy.

Now replace "kernel suspends" with "let the kernel know it can drop into
suspend level idle". The power management code will handle the races
beyond point X for you.

So for that you simply need a constraint to remain above suspend level
idle that you drop where it says "prod kernel" and pick up on "resume"
