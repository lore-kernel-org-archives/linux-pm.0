            <- wakeup event that should be delivered to untrusted app arrives here

At this point you may mark the downtrodden group as ignored between the 
untrusted app receiving the event and the untrusted app marking itself 
as important. To avoid this you need the UI manager to receive every 
wakeup event in order to change its scheduling decisions.

(The cgroup has to have some awareness of suspend/resume so that it can 
allow the untrusted apps to be scheduled again)

The timeout-based nature means that if the application doesn't get 
scheduled for some reason (say there's heavy swap pressure - not likely 
in the embedded world, but an issue on laptop-type devices) the event 
may not be handled before you get back to sleep. I accept that this 
isn't likely to be a problem in the real world, but it does make this 
mechanism less deterministic than a suspend block based one.

Not just the button driver. Every driver that generates wakeupa. This 
gets difficult when it comes to the network layer, for instance, when 
the network driver has very little idea how the packet it just received 
will be routed.

The problem is that you still have a race, and fixing that race requires 
every event that could generate a wakeup to be proxied out to the policy 
manager as well. That's a moderate additional overhead.
