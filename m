Not at all.  These drivers rely on the bus-level code's suspend 
routine to handle system suspend.  They don't rely on runtime PM.

No, it isn't.  You can always write callbacks that get compiled even
when CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME isn't enabled.  It's very easy -- all you have
to do is change

	#ifdef CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME

to

	#ifdef CONFIG_PM

It's only a misunderstanding.  There is no dependency.

Same misunderstanding as before.  The drivers merely need to be written 
so that the callbacks are compiled whenever CONFIG_PM is enabled rather 
than CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME.
