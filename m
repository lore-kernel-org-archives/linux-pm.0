It can't happen in an ISR, to be precise.

It's not exactly the same.  The difference is that you're talking about race
conditions between runtime PM and system suspend (I kind of know why I wanted
system suspend to block runtime PM now :-)) that may be prevented by
subsystem-level code from happening (by using locking and some flags etc.),
while that code cannot do much if its .runtime_suspend() callback, for example,
is executed directly from the system suspend code path.

I agree.

No, please.

The problem here is that I don't want runtime PM stuff to be called during
the "noirq" stages of system suspend and resume which the freezing of the
workqueue takes care of nicely.

No, I'm not.  In fact, I'm going to apply your patch. :-)

Thanks,
