It checks if a resume request is pending and executes runtime resume in that
case.

First off, I don't really see a reason for a subsystem to call
pm_runtime_resume() from its .suspend_noirq() callback.  Now, if
pm_runtime_resume() is to be called concurrently with the subsystem's
.suspend_noirq() callback, I'd rather won't let that happen. :-)

It also may trigger for drivers using non-freezable workqueues and calling
runtime PM synchronously from there.

I _really_ think that the initial approach, i.e. before commit
e8665002477f0278f84f898145b1f141ba26ee26, made the most sense.  It didn't
cover the "pm_runtime_resume() called during system suspend" case, but
it did cover everything else.

So, I think there are serious technical arguments for reverting that commit.

I think we went really far trying to avoid that, but I'm not sure I want to go
any further.

Thanks,
Rafael
