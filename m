Huh, I still don't get that. Sorry.

If the "may_skip_resume" is default set to true by the PM core,
wouldn't that just mean that the middle-layer needs to implement an
opt-out method, rather than opt-in. In principle to opt-out the
middle-layer needs to set may_skip_resume to false in suspend_noirq
phase, no?

Then we only need to make sure drivers don't starts use
LEAVE_SUSPENDED, before we make sure the middle layers is adopted. But
that should not be a problem.

The benefit would be that those middle layers that can cope with
LEAVE_SUSPENDED as of today don't need to change.

Kind regards
Uffe
