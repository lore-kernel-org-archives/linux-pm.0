Yes.

Even if this is a PCI-MMC/SD driver, we can also have wakeup GPIO
irqs, for example to handle card detect when inserting/removing an SD
card.

The point is, there are cases when the driver has this of information,
but upper layer doesn't.

Right, on those SoC I mostly work on, this data comes from DT.
However, on some SoCs this data come from platform data as well.

Right, however device_may_wakeup() may still return true for the device.

Well, let's try to agree on how to best describe the problem first. It
seems like we are soon getting there. :-)
