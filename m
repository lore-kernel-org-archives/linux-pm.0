Having a somewhat different ABI for achieving things you'll probably have 
prepare for. I doubt it would result in any large-scale, massive rewrites.

So why arent those bits mainline? It's a 1000 times easier to get drivers and 
small improvements and non-ABI changes upstream.

After basically two years of growing your fork (and some attempts to get your 
drivers into drivers/staging/ - from where they have meanwhile dropped out 
again) you re-started with the worst possible thing to merge: a big and 
difficult kernel feature affecting many subsystems. Why?

This is one of the fundamental problems here. People simply dont know you, 
because you have not worked with us much - and hence they dont trust you 
positively out of box - they are neutral at best.

And believe me, it's hard enough to get difficult features upstream if people 
_do_ know you and when they positively _do_ trust you ... Arent you talking to 
Andrew Morton about how to do these things properly? This is kernel 
contribution 101 really.

I've been tracking android-common and android-msm for a while and i have to 
say that it shows a very lackluster attitude towards upstream:

 - The latest branches i can see are v2.6.32 based today. We are in the
   v2.6.35 stabilization cycle and are developing v2.6.36. I.e. your upstream
   base is about a year too old.

 - The last commit is a couple of weeks old AFAICS.

 - The diffstat of android-common/android-2.6.32 is:

      890 files changed, 39962 insertions(+), 6286 deletions(-)

   Those assorted patches have spread over nearly a thousand files. FYI, by
   the looks of it you are facing an exponentially worsening maintenance
   overhead curve here.

Is there perhaps some other tree i should be following? I'm looking at:

 [remote "android-msm"]
         url = git://android.git.kernel.org/kernel/msm.git
         fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/android-msm/*
 [remote "android-common"]
         url = git://android.git.kernel.org/kernel/common.git
         fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/android-common/*

Btw., the commits i've glanced at looked mostly clean and well structured, so 
i see no fundamental reason why this couldn't be done better.

Well, my suggestion would be to first build up a path towards upstream, build 
up trust, reduce your very high cross section to mainline - and do the most 
difficult bits last.

Especially 'move on with our lives' suggests that you just want to get rid of 
this ABI divergence and continue-as-usual with the pattern of non-cooperation, 
hm?

It's not crazy, it's just IMHO inefficient and very difficult to do it like 
that. And you arent the first one to try it like that (people _always_ 
gravitate towards coming with their most difficult patches first - because 
they are very often the most useful patches) - it's a non-trivial learning 
curve IMHO.
