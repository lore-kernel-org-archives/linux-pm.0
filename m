Even better.

I'm not even going to dignify that stupid question with a response.

Where is it likely to be documented?  MFD is pretty simple and seldom
needs explanation.  A 3 second look at the API you're trying to use
(instead of blind copy & paste) would have told you that it's possible
to take an IRQ domain as an argument.

It's only the craziness in this patch which forced me to look into how
Regmap handles IRQs and come up with a subsequent solution which fits
your use-case.

The whole point of this solution is that you don't need to pass
anything non-standard (i.e. not provided by the current APIs) to the
child device.
