I'm not sure I get this part to be honest.

The image kernel will use its own page tables with the original
address space layout no matter what, so I'm not sure why it needs the
seed.

Also the loading of the image is based on PFNs and not on virtual
addresses, so during resume all of the page frames used before
hibernation will be populated with the same data regardless of the
randomization.

One of the weak points is the final jump, because it has to be done to
the physical location of the image kernel's entry point even though
the virtual addresses of it may differ between the boot and the image
kernels.  The seed is not needed for that, only the physical address
of the entry point.  The boot kernel doesn't have it today, though,
because the virtual address of that is passed in the image header.
That should not be too difficult to change, however.

The second weak point is the temporary page tables setup in
swsusp_arch_resume(), but as I said in the quoted message, that can be
addressed by copying the existing page tables (of the boot kernel)
instead of creating new ones from scratch - or by ensuring that the
new ones will be laid out in exactly the same way.  Again, the seed is
not necessary here, because all of that is confined to the boot kernel
only.

Thanks,
Rafael
