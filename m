We're not talking about waking up the system.  I'm concerned more about
how the keypad is supposed to work in the scenario Dmitry brought up.  
But evidently things are too variable to say much for certain.

I get the impression that in many cases the entire keypad will have to 
remain functional, and it will be up to userspace to discard keys that 
aren't wanted at a particular time.

"Kicking devices into low power mode" is ambiguous.  How about 
"requesting that an idle device go into low-power mode" instead?  This 
doesn't carry an implication that the user could force a non-idle 
device to suspend or could force the driver to do something against its 
will.

Of course, if the device is idle then it's natural to ask why it isn't 
already in low-power mode.  Maybe it's waiting for an autosuspend 
timer to expire; anything else doesn't make much sense.

Stop after "communicate specific events to individual devices" (or
drivers).  I don't agree that userspace should always have the ability
to put devices into specific power states.

I don't understand this at all.  How does autosuspend conflict with 
system suspend?  Your example isn't clear.

PM does indeed provide a sysfs attribute for enabling/disabling
individual devices for low-power mode.  It doesn't provide an attribute
for _forcing_ a device into low-power mode, and I don't think it
should.  The driver should always be in charge.

This has not yet been settled.  Why do we need an "ondemand" flag when 
we already have power/control?

Including some sort of interface for cutting short an autosuspend delay
makes sense (and doing it doesn't require a new attribute), but I'm not 
convinced that anything else is needed.
