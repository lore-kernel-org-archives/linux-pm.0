But you don't have to freeze user space for this purpose, do you?
You may simply send a SIGSTOP to those processes.

Yes, it is.

Well, saying "a little" is an overstatement. :-)

This was given as one of the arguments why using the wakelocks mechanism
along with the opportunistic suspend might be regarded as a good idea, but
I think the _real_ reason why it is used by Android is that the system
suspend framework was usable already when Android was being developed and if
they wanted to get acceptable battery lives at that time, they simply had no
choice but to use it.

That's going backwards somewhat.  First, a suspend user is supposed to choose
what devices can wake up the system in response to external events, so he
can choose to not allow any devices to do that.  Second, if external wakeup
sigals (and such that the user doesn't control directly) are enabled, this
basically means that the user allows someone else to wake up the system.
He may not know when this happens, but that's a bit like saying
"I don't need you now, but if someone else does, so be it."

Starting system suspend means exactly that: "Go to a sleep state, because
I'm not going to use you now (until I will wake you up)".

Now, you can set an RTC etc. to wake up the system from sleep states, so
people thought it might mean something different, but it simply doesn't.

I generally agree, but "system" should not be confused with "the kernel".

Let me rephrase what I have already said for many times: system suspend
interface in the kernel is for user space, so that it can put the system into
a sleep state at any time.  The decision to use it need not be made
directly by the user, but from the kernel's point of view it doesn't matter.
The interface is there and it works how it works.

I think I know what Paul meant here.  Namely, whether or not subsystems (or
platforms) can use this information in the runtime PM context.  In my opinion
that might be possible, but it would requre us to distinguish between situations
in which the wakeup setting should and should not be taken into account.

Quite frankly, it's not entirely new to me and I seem to remember it being
mentioned during the discussion following the Android wakelocks patches
submission.

Anyway, the system suspend (and hibernation) interface is what it is and
there are good reasons why it is desigened this way.  To me, as I said already
before, the question is not if it can be replaced with something else, because
it can't (there are platforms where something else won't work), but if a
given platofrm has a reason to support it.  That, of course, depends on the
platform in question, but surely every platform wanting to support Android
pretty much has to support the system suspend interface too. :-)

I, personally, think that there are good reasons to support it too, but my
reasons need not be everyone's reasons.

Thanks,
Rafael
