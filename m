I'm not a PM guru, but this ordering seems fragile.  If we offline
CPUs before re-targeting interrupts directed at those CPUs, aren't we
always going to be at risk of sending interrupts to an offline CPU?

Even if the device is now asleep and therefore should not generate an
interrupt, it seems like there's a window when the device returns to
PCI_D0 where it could generate an interrupt before we have a chance to
update the MSI message.
