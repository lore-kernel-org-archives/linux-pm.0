But the new rpm_callback() _does_ simply execute the callback under the
spinlock in the irq-safe case.  So I don't understand what you mean
here.

Because pm_runtime_put_sync() calls rpm_idle().  If there were no 
irq-safe version of rpm_idle() then drivers wouldn't be able to call 
pm_runtime_put_sync() from within an interrupt handler.

On the contrary; spin_unlock() after spin_lock_irq() doesn't partially
release the lock -- it releases the lock _entirely_!  :-)

Besides which, the existing code already releases the spinlock before 
making callbacks, so there should be no reason to worry about that 
issue.  The new code either:

	releases the spinlock but keeps interrupts disabled (in
	rpm_idle), or

	doesn't release the spinlock (in rpm_callback).

Either way, I should think you'd find the new code _less_ objectionable 
than the existing code, not _more_ objectionable.
