These are expected to be out-of-band, so not having anything to do
with the Root Complex.

In-band PME Messages go through the PCIe hierarchy, but that is a
standard mechanism and it is supported already.

WAKE# are platform-specific, pretty much by definition and I guess
that on most ARM boards they are just going to be some kind of GPIO
pins.

So if my understanding is correct, DT should give you the WAKE# IRQ
for the given endpoint PCI device and you only are expected to request
it.   The rest should just follow from the other pieces of information
in the DT.

With the quite obvious caveat that the same IRQ may be used as WAKE#
for multiple endpoint devices (which BTW need not be under the same
bridge even).

Not only racy, as I don't see anything to prevent user space from
making the dev->power.wakeup wakeup source go away via sysfs at any
time *after* the IRQ has been requested.

Pretty much right after dev_pm_set_dedicated_wake_irq() has returned,
device_wakeup_disable() may be called on the device via wakeup_store()
and it doesn't even check if the device has a wakeup irq.

Well, that looks necessary to be honest.
