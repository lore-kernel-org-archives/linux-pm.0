It is not really practical: there are many consumers of input events, if
we build infrastructure to control it and proxy all users through it,
why not have it in kernel? Plus, there are users of input events
directly in the kernel, such as legacy VT/keyboard, or Android/ChromeOS
cpufreq_interactive governor that monitors user activity and bumps up
CPU speed when user actively interacts with the device. They would keep
input devices active even though user might not be actually able to
use some input devices.

Thanks.
