Well, the patch is not recent.  The _commit_ is more than three months old
and the patch has been around since the last November (at least).

Well, I can only call that a blatant abuse of the PM infrastructure.

It's not a solution at all, because there's code that depends on it already in
the tree and the fact that it works for you doesn't mean it won't break other
systems.  So no, it's not an option.

The only fix I can think of is to rework SDIO to stop abusing the PM callbacks.
I'll have a look at that next week, although I can't promise anything any time
soon, because I'm heading to San Francisco on Saturday.

Thanks,
