I think my concerns boils done to that I am wondering how useful it
will be, in general, to enable the core to skip invoking resume
callbacks.

Although, if you are targeting some specific devices/drivers (ACPI,
PCI, etc), and not care that much about flexibility, then I am fine
with it. The approach seems to work.

Let me elaborate on that comment a bit.

1)
Skipping resume callbacks is not going to work for a device that may
be attached to the generic PM domain.

Well, in principle one could try to re-work genpd to cope with this
behavior, I guess, but that would also mean genpd becomes limited to
always use the noirq callbacks to power on/off the PM domain. That
isn't an acceptable limitation.

2)
Because of 1) This leads to those cross SoC drivers, dealing with
devices which sometimes may have a genpd attached and sometimes an
ACPI PM domain attached. I guess those drivers would need to have a
different set of system-wide PM callbacks, depending on the PM domain
the device is attached to, as to achieve a similar optimized behavior
during system resume. Or some other cleverness to deal with
system-wide PM.

Perhaps we can ignore both 1) and 2), because the number of cross SoC
drivers having these issues should be rather limited!?

3)
There are certainly lots of drivers that can cope with its device
remaining in runtime suspend, during system resume.
Although, some of these drivers may have some additional operations to
carry out during resume, which may not require to resume (activate)
its device. For example the driver may need to resume a queue,
re-configure an out-of-band wakeup (GPIO IRQ), re-configure pinctrls,
etc.

These drivers can't use the method behind LEAVE_SUSPENDED, because
they need their resume callbacks to be invoked.

I think I have pointed out some issues above. Feel free to ignore
them, depending on what your target is.

Yes.

Okay, then it's fine as is (because of your other patch to the runtime
PM core, which changes the behavior for pm_runtime_set_suspended()).

BTW, I have some additional minor comments to some other parts of the
code, but I will start over with a new thread proving you with those
comments.

Kind regards
