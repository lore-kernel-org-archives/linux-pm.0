To me, this seem like the wrong way of how to configure wake-ups for
these kind of devices.

I don't think the regular IRQs shall be enabled and the driver
shouldn't assume the registers are accessible without first runtime
resuming the device.

For a more thorough explanation to why I don't like, please have a
look at my comment for another related thread on the mmc list.
