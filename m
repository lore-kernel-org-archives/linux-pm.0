And difficult to see how to implement something using freezer cgroups 
that actually works in this case. Look, I don't want to sound like I 
have a one-track mind or anything, but all of these arguments would be 
significantly more compelling if someone would actually provide a 
concrete implementation proposal that deals with the set of use-cases 
that Google's implementation does and which doesn't make anyone cry. 
Otherwise the immeasurably most likely outcome is that this code gets 
merged and we get to live with it.
