The following series arose from trying to use BeagleBoard-XM (OMAP3 variant)
for doing CPU DVFS using cpufreq-cpu0.

This is also an attempt to slowly remove the dependence on omap-cpufreq
driver and be entirely driven off cpufreq-cpu0 driver.

Somewhere in the future, when we have regulators driven off CCF and OMAP
converted to CCF, we could remove the DT regulator requirements as well.

Based on v3.9-rc2 tag

Nishanth Menon (2):
  cpufreq: cpufreq-cpu0: support for clock which are not in DT yet.
  cpufreq: cpufreq-cpu0: provide compatibility string for DT matchup

OMAP Caveat: AVS+ABB still wont work with just these changes.
More to come as we progress.
