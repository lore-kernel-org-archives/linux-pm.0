I had probed and verified voltage on beagle and beagle XM. OMAP4
obviously wont scale (as mentioned) due to the fact that vc-vp regulator
is needed.

thanks for the script. yep - I can use this as well, but given that probe
did verify voltage scale on TWL5030 inductors, it might be redundant.

I can take it again and show the same snap along with the log with the
mentioned script later today.
