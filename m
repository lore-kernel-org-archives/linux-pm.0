Yeah, if you could share the logs would be great to understand where the

I agree here. Apparently, the expectations of the API were wrong. I
agree on refraining from calling it multiple times before it finishes.

But, I said this before, and I will repeat myself. I believe thermal is
not the only user of this API, maybe the problem is more apparent for
thermal because we call it multiple times, and we want it to finishes,
but even after fixing the serialization on thermal side, we can still
collide with other parts of the kernel and userland.

I agree here. Also, a graceful thermal shutdown may also mean displaying
a message, etc. In this case, you have to size properly the trip,
accounting shutdown down time, and your reliability expectation.

I think the code needs to allow doing both, actually. Considering both,
the silicon and system reliability, and userland (and end user)
interaction, the thermal shutdown typically needs to:
1. Make sure it avoids reliability problems, i.e., one shall not allow
device to run on out-of-spec temperature.
2. Give the opportunity for the system to gracefully shutdown, so you
have the time to keep system state sane (save your data, notify user,
etc), even if you are on a 56K modem :-)

I think it is enough if we make sure the first one goes through
properly. For accountability purposes, some people would like to also
know if other sensors are too hot too, and could be also firing the
shutdown.

Only making sure that the first shutdown goes all the way through,
and block any other thermal shutdowns, it is enough. Then again, I do
not think you need to cancel all the monitoring in the system.

Given the above points, my suggestion is to:
1. still call orderly_poweroff(), therefore, you still give the
opportunity for userland to gracefully power off.
2. but still make sure, once one of the zones hits critical, no other
will call orderly_poweroff()
3. Also, when in the critical path, make sure there is no way back, or
long delays, allowing system engineer to size the shutdown wait.
Shutdown wait is a system property, not a zone property. That is, we
eventually call kernel_power_off().

All in all, 1. and 2. above are part of what you found and what has been
proposed to make sure we call orderly_poweroff() only once, system wide
(or at least thermal subsystem wide). And 3. is pretty much the proposed
patch in this series, I think this still needs to go, and I am convinced
that thermal core is best place to write the backup mechanism, given the
expected variability of orderly_poweroff().
