Well, I don't think this is related.

In the meantime, I went back to my original .config and verified that
setting CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC in it caused hibernation to fail (with
CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_MEMORY set and with the $subject patch applied), so
this really matters somehow.

Besides, now that I have a reproducer, I can check various other
things and for example this change (sorry for broken whitespace):

makes hibernation work for me again in the above configuration.  To
me, this means that the $subject patch works as expected and the
problem really is related to the vaddr value being too big.

Thanks,
