Well, I suspected that something like this would surface. ;-)

Are there any major reasons why the appended patch (obviously untested) won't
work, then?

How so?

I'm talking about a change like in the appended patch, where
pm_runtime_force_* simply invoke driver callbacks directly.  What is
skipped there is middle-layer stuff which is empty anyway in all cases
except for AMBA (if that's all what is lurking below the surface), so
I don't quite see how the failure will happen.

With the appended patch applied things should work for AMBA like for
any other bus type implementing PM, so I don't see why not.

Well, sorry about that.  I would like to be able to explain my point to you so
that you understand my perspective, but if that's not working, that's not a
sufficient reason for me to give up.

I'm just refusing to maintain code that I don't agree with in the long run.

Not unconditionally, which would be fair to mention.

Only if it is called in ->prepare or as the first thing in a ->suspend
callback.  Later than that is broken too in principle.

The "layering violation" is all about things possibly occurring in a
wrong order.  For example, say a middle-layer ->runtime_suspend is
called via pm_runtime_force_suspend() which in turn is called from
middle-layer ->suspend_late as a driver callback.  If the ->runtime_suspend
does anything significat to the device, then executing the remaining part of
->suspend_late will almost cetainly break things, more or less.

That is not a concern with a middle-layer ->runtime_resume running
*before* a middle-layer ->suspend (or any subsequent callbacks) does
anything significant to the device.

Is there anything in the above which is not clear enough?

Because they aren't just PCI subsystem limitations only.  The need to handle
wakeup setup differently for runtime PM and system sleep is not PCI-specific.
The need to handle suspend and hibernation differently isn't too.

Those things may be more obvious in PCI, but they are generic rather than
special.

Also, quite so often other middle layers interact with PCI directly or
indirectly (eg. a platform device may be a child or a consumer of a PCI
device) and some optimizations need to take that into account (eg. parents
generally need to be accessible when their childres are resumed and so on).

Moreover, the majority of the "other subsystems/middle-layers" you've talked
about so far don't provide any PM callbacks to be invoked by pm_runtime_force_*,
so question is how representative they really are.

Which also works for PCI and the ACPI PM domain and that's sort of valuable
anyway, isn't it?

For the record, I don't think it will be too hard to get rid of
pm_runtime_force_suspend|resume(), although that may take quite some time.

Frankly, this sounds like staging for indefinite blocking of changes in
this area on non-technical grounds.  I hope that it isn't the case ...

We'll see.

There clearly are use cases that benefit from this series and I don't see
any alternatives covering them, including both direct-complete and the
pm_runtime_force* approach, so I'm not buying this "let's make sure
it can cover all possible use cases that exist" argumentation.

Thanks,
