Yes, that's the drawback.

The PCI PM specification version 1.2 says this in chapter 4.2 (page 37):

  There is a minimum time requirement of 50 ms which must be provided by
  system software between when the bus is switched from B2 to B0 and
  when a function on the bus is accessed to allow time for the clock to
  start up and the bus to settle.

Not sure how much of that still applies to modern hardware.

I don't see why we cannot increase autosuspend delay time, though.
