At the moment, drivers aren't told what suspend state the system is
going into.  They know the difference between suspend and hibernate,
but the PM core doesn't tell drivers whether it's going into standby
vs. suspend.  (Strictly speaking, those terms apply mostly to ACPI
systems and not so much elsewhere.  What I'm talking about is the
/sys/power/state interface, where the user can write either "standby"
or "mem".  Drivers aren't told which was written.)

I imagine platforms have to answer all such questions when they decide 
exactly how they will implement "standby" and "mem".

I'm not aware of any progress.
