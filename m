The NHI driver is bound to bridge 0?  Your diagram indicates this but 
you don't say so explicitly.

This may be a naive question: The diagram indicates a single upstream 
bridge attached to a bunch of downstream bridges with nothing in 
between.  Is that really how the kernel treats Thunderbolt controllers?

In all other controllers that I'm familiar with, there's a device to 
represent the controller, another device representing its upward link, 
and a bunch of devices representing the downward links.  The analogous 
approach here would make bridges 1 ... n children of bridge 0 (which 
sounds strange but might make more sense in the end).

The way you're doing it, how does the NHI driver know when to go into 
suspend?  The runtime PM core won't notify it when all the hotplugged 
devices attached to the other bridges have been suspended, since it's 
not their parent.

Or you could interpose another device structure between the upstream 
bridge and all the downstream bridges.
