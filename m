Well, this is a SHOULD, not a MUST.  If you want your driver to leave a
device in a low-power state, it can do so.  Just bear in mind that the
PM core's idea of the device's runtime power state may end up not
matching reality unless you're careful.

Maybe; it depends on the situation.  In the embedded world you're 
likely to have this under better control than in the desktop world.

Yes; you could bring the device to full power during resume from 
hibernation and leave it at low power during resume from system 
suspend.

Again, this depends on the situation.  It probably won't come up in 
your case.

That would indeed be the most logical approach.  But it turns out not 
to be entirely feasible for various odd reasons, which I don't remember 
at the moment.

Of course, even if all devices do get turned on during resume, one 
would expect the normal runtime PM mechanism to power them down again 
very shortly after the resume is finished.

The PM core tries to be flexible, but there are limitations.  In
particular, it's not very well suited for handling devices with
multiple power levels.  Drivers simply have to do the best they can to
fit in with the PM core's power model.  For example, all functional
states might be considered "full power" and all others might be
considered "low power".  Coordinating all the extra details would then
be the driver's responsibility.
