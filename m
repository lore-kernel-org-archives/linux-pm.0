Let me think about it.
If I get you right, the device model would be, from a parenthood point of view:
             pxa2xx_ac97 (platform_device)
                  ^
                  |
             ac97_controller.dev (device, son of pxa2xx_ac97)
                 / \
                /   \
               /     \
              /       \
             /         \
         wm97xx-core  codec2     (sons ac97_controller.dev)

I have already the device hierarchy AFAIK, created in ac97_codec_add(). I'm
still failing to see the difference, as the refcounting is already used. The
only additional thing I see is the introduction of an intermediate
ac97_controller.dev which is refcounted.

In current model, pxa2xx_ac97 refcount is incremented for each codec device. In
the one you propose, pxa2xx_ac97 will be 1 refcounted (maybe 2 actually), and
ac97_controller.dev will be refcounted for each codec. This ac97_controller.dev
will be a spiritual twin of spi_master/i2c_adapter.

As I said, I must think about it and find which value is brought by this
additionnal layer.

As for the name change, I must check if this breaks the sound machine files, and
their dai_link structures (ex: mioa701_wm9713.c, structure mioa701_dai). In a
former state of this patchset I had changed the device names, ie. wm9713-codec
became pxa2xx-ac97.0, and the my machine file became broken.

I will.

Fair enough.

Because in the meantime, a regulator or something else provided power to the
AC97 IP, or a clock, and it can answer to requests after that.

And another point if that the clock of controller might be provided by the AC97
codec, and the scan will only succeed once the codec is actually providing this
clock, which it might do only once the module_init() is done.

Power wise a periodical scan doesn't look good, at all.

More globally, I don't see if there is an actual issue we're trying to address
here, ie. that the rescan is a bug, or if it's more an "Occam's razor"
discussion ?

The first one that popped out:
 - hac_soc_platform_probe()
