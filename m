Of course you don't explicitly *have to* respect the hierarchy of the
RPM callbacks in pm_runtime_force_*.

However, changing that would require some additional information
exchange between the driver and the middle-layer/PM domain, as to
instruct the middle-layer/PM domain of what to do during system-wide
PM. Especially in cases when the driver deals with wakeup, as in those
cases the instructions may change dynamically.

Well, no matter if the wrappers are used or not, we need some kind of
information exchange between the driver and the middle-layers/PM
domains.

Anyway, me personally think it's too early to conclude that using the
wrappers may not be useful going forward. At this point, they clearly
helps trivial cases to remain being trivial.

Yes.

Actually, this scenario is also addressed when using the pm_runtime_force_*.

The driver for the child would only need to bump the runtime PM usage
count (pm_runtime_get_noresume()) before calling
pm_runtime_force_suspend() at system suspend. That then also
propagates to the parent, leading to that both the parent and the
child will be resumed when pm_runtime_force_resume() is called for
them.

Of course, if the driver of the parent isn't using pm_runtime_force_,
we would have to assume that it's always being resumed at system
resume.

As at matter of fact, doesn't this scenario actually indicates that we
do need to involve the runtime PM core (updating RPM status according
to the HW state even during system-wide PM) to really get this right.
It's not enough to only use "driver PM flags"!?

Seems like we need to create a list of all requirements, pitfalls,
good things vs bad things etc. :-)

Yes, but that too easy and to me not good enough. :-)
