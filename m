Hi,

Sorry to be jumping in late. My few comments dispersed with
individual replies

Yes. At least on the U8500 (and couple of OMAPs as well), it is the 
always-on power button on AB8500/TWLs that is the necessary event 
to turn off the display/keypad. The entire display/keypad themselves
cannot wakeup the system. But on the older phones, we generally had
to have the menu + star combination to unlock the phone, which falls into
the main keypad.

Coming in late, I would just like to summarize some of the points; please
correct if I am wrong:

- user space intervention is required to communicate specific events
  to individual devices to put them into an appropriate power state.

- auto suspend isn't the correct choice for input devices as they may
  conflict with system suspend (touch screen off/idle needs to be sync'ed
  with system suspend as with a lock switch)

- PM ATM doesn't provide a sysfs attribute for enabling/disabling or forcing
  an individual device into low power mode unlike for platform. However a new
  "suspend_ondemand" flag can enable such devices to be put into appropriate
  states via a /sys/devices/.../power/ by the user space.

If my above summarization is correct, I personally feel the on demand flag is a clean
option for the current requirement.

Cheers!
Sundar
