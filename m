OK, so the ->probe() part has been explained and makes sense, but I
would expect ->remove() to be similarily protected (as the documentation
states.)  But that is not the case.  Is that a bug?  If so, patch below
makes the code match the documentation.

Subject: [PATCH] driver core: prevent runtime PM races with ->remove()

Runtime PM Documentation states that the runtime PM usage count is
incremented during driver ->probe() and ->remove().  This is designed
to prevent driver runtime PM races with subsystems which may initiate
runtime PM transitions before during and after drivers are loaded.

Current code increments the usage_count during ->probe() but not
during ->remove().  This patch fixes the ->remove() part and makes the
code match the documentation.
