The first post was niether rejected nor accepted in ML. So I added
"resend" tag in case it appears in the archive finally.

You're right. Config space registers are accessible. The driver can't
read/write MMIO registers (Device-Specific Registers as they're called
by Broadcom).

The proposed patch was a sort of workaround. If this approach is not
acceptable then it needs more research how to change PLX driver that it
can play with PM to access MMIO registers.
