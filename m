Because he is using a robust kernel that provides suspend blockers and
is preventing the vampire from sucking power? 

Most users don't even grasp the simple concept of different "programs".
They just have a device and click here and there and are happy. 

Really, what are you getting at? Do you deny that there are programs,
that prevent a device from sleeping? (Just think of the bouncing
cows app)

And if you have two kernels, one with which your device is dead after 1
hour and one with which your device is dead after 10 hours. Which would
you prefer? I mean really... this is ridiculous. 

Cheers,
