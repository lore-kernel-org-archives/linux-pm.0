Instead of just removing the check completely on x86, IMO restrict it to
some newer/later version of ACPI so you can still force vendors to fix
their ACPI tables at-least in future.

It would be good to get such sanity check in the tools used to build
those tables, but yes since such static tables can be built in many
ways, its difficult to deal it in all those tools.
