Your observations is correct. The hardware will be kept active
in-between the probe attempts (and thus also if probing fails).
Although, that's not a regression as that's the behaviour you get from
runtime PM, when drivers are implemented like omap_hsmmc.

Instead of the suggested approaches, I think the regression should be
fixed at the PM domain level (omap hwmod). I have attached a patch
below, please give it try as it's untested.

To solve the other problem (allowing devices to become inactive
in-between at probe failures), I see two options (not treated as
regressions).
1)
Change the behaviour of pm_runtime_put_sync(), to *not* respect the
autosuspend mode.
I think I prefer this option, as it seems like autosuspend should be
respected only via the asynchronous runtime PM APIs.

2)
Change the failing drivers, to before calling pm_runtime_put_sync()
also invoke pm_runtime_dont_use_autosusend(). Or other similar
approach.

Kind regards
Uffe

Subject: [PATCH] ARM: OMAP2+: omap-device: Allow devices to be pre-enabled

Commit 5de85b9d57ab ("PM / runtime: Re-init runtime PM states at probe
error and driver unbind") may re-initialize the runtime PM status of the
device to RPM_SUSPENDED at driver probe failures.

For the omap_hsmmc and likely also other omap drivers, which needs more
than one attempt to ->probe() (returning -EPROBE_DEFER), this commit
causes a regression at the PM domain level (omap hwmod).

The reason is that the drivers don't put back the device into low power
state while bailing out in ->probe to return -EPROBE_DEFER. This leads to
that pm_runtime_reinit() in driver core, is re-initializing the runtime PM
status from RPM_ACTIVE to RPM_SUSPENDED.

The next ->probe() attempt then triggers the ->runtime_resume() callback
to be invoked, which means this happens two times in a row. At the PM
domain level (omap hwmod) this is being treated as an error and thus the
runtime PM status of the device isn't correctly synchronized with the
runtime PM core.

In the end, ->probe() anyway succeeds (as the driver don't checks the
error code from the runtime PM APIs), but results in that the PM domain
always stays powered on. This because of the runtime PM core believes the
device is RPM_SUSPENDED.

Fix this regression by allowing devices to be pre-enabled when the PM
domain's (omap hwmod) ->runtime_resume() callback is requested to enable
the device. In such cases, return zero to synchronize the runtime PM
status with the runtime PM core.

Fixes: 5de85b9d57ab ("PM / runtime: Re-init runtime PM states at probe
error and driver unbind")
