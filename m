Why do you say that?

A significant amount of drivers should be able to cope with only the
runtime PM callbacks, if only the PM core have respected the drivers
in the way my RFC proposes.

In the end, I want to achieve simpler use of runtime PM for drivers.
As you will see below, a vast amount of drivers has got it wrong and
to me that indicates we have not fully succeeded in keeping it as
simple as I think we could have done.

Sure, but even if documentation would be improved (actually I think it
is quite good already), I think the behaviour of the PM core is what
causes the confusion.

It is obvious to you guys, working with this for a long time and with
these subsystem that clearly benefit from having the PM core to
prevent runtime suspend during system suspend. Not so sure this is the
case for others.

Well, it was included in 3.4, soon 1.5 years ago, but still only a
handful occurrences. That ought to tell us something. :-)

I think it indicates two things. One, the documentation has likely not
been thoroughly read by authors. Second, authors are not expecting the
current behaviour of PM core.

This is just a subset of drivers I found:
drivers/pwm/pwm-tiecap.c
drivers/pwm/pwm-tiehrpwm.c
arch/arm/mach-omap2/gpmc.c
drivers/char/hw_random/omap-rng.c
drivers/crypto/omap-aes.c
drivers/crypto/omap-sham.c
drivers/input/keyboard/sh_keysc.c
drivers/media/platform/davinci/vpif.c
drivers/media/platform/davinci/vpss.c
drivers/mtd/devices/elm.c

Sure, that requires some more deeper analyse, but anyway I found these:
drivers/mmc/host/mmci.c
drivers/mmc/host/sdhci-pxav3.c
drivers/power/bq24190_charger.c

I have tried to iron what you say above, not sure I got it completely
right though:

drivers/mfd/arizona-core.c
drivers/mmc/host/sdhci-s3c.c
drivers/spi/spi-tegra114.c
drivers/spi/spi-tegra20-sflash.c
drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_dw.c

I am not saying these are bugs, but it kind of indicates that the
author is not fully aware of how to use runtime PM in system suspend.
The proper thing to do, should have been to use pm_runtime_disable,
like the PM core in suspend late, before inactivating the device.

drivers/ata/libata-core.c
drivers/gpu/drm/exynos/exynos_drm_ipp.c
drivers/gpu/drm/exynos/exynos_drm_fimc.c
drivers/gpu/drm/exynos/exynos_drm_gsc.c
drivers/gpu/drm/exynos/exynos_drm_rotator.c
drivers/gpu/drm/exynos/exynos_hdmi.c:
drivers/dma/sirf-dma.c

Still runtime PM should be disabled (pm_runtime_disable) to handle
this properly, which is not the case in my examples above.

Not sure what you mean here, why should runtime suspend always enable
wakeup? Is that not depending on the current situation?

I don't see how these are in conflict? The idea was that drivers that
requires it's device to be runtime resumed to be able to have wakeup
cap set, should just prevent runtime suspend (pm_runtime_get). I might
have explained this in some badly written English, sorry if I confused
you. :-)
