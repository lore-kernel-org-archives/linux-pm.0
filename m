Least squares fitting of my coefficients to your tables.

How big battery do you have? According to least squares fitting,
assuming maximum charge of .46A, you were taking about 25mA when
doing the discharge test.

Yah, and your battery meter will be wrong in such case, as will be
mine, because they are based on same information. The thing is, mine
can be improved without adding more tables.=20

Umm. When not calling, your phone should not heat itself up. And you
definitely can power it down, leave it in outer pocket, then power it
up. It is actually something people do when they want to preserve batte=
ry...

Because then other users can share the same code, and because you
avoid big ugly tables in dts.

And my email suggested solution better than your driver, so why not
just use it?

Badness is error in least squares method.
