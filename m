This is a good summary in my view.

The only thing we can add, realistically, is an interface for user
space to "kick" drivers to check if the devices they handle may be
suspended at this point (or to run their ->runtime_idle callbacks
IOW).

That would be quite similar to autosuspend except that the "kick" will
come from user space rather than from a timer function in the kernel.

Thanks,
Rafael
