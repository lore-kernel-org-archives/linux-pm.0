Hi Linus,

Please pull from

 git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rafael/linux-pm.git \
 pm+acpi-4.5-rc1-1

to receive the first batch of power management and ACPI updates for
v4.5-rc1 with top-most commit a889f766dbb7d016b858e4dd157b06587fdb570f

 Merge branch 'powercap'

on top of commit afd2ff9b7e1b367172f18ba7f693dfb62bdcb2dc

 Linux 4.4

As far as the number of commits goes, ACPICA takes the lead
this time, followed by cpufreq and the device properties
framework changes.

The most significant new feature is the debugfs-based interface
to the ACPICA's AML debugger added in the previous cycle and
a new user space tool for accessing it.

On the cpufreq front, the core is updated to handle governors
more efficiently, particularly on systems where a single cpufreq
policy object is shared between multiple CPUs, and there are
quite a few changes in drivers (intel_pstate, cpufreq-dt etc).

The device properties framework is updated to handle built-in
(ie. included in the kernel itself) device properties better,
among other things by adding a fallback mechanism that will
allow drivers to provide default properties to be used in
case the plaform firmware doesn't provide the properties
expected by them.

The Operating Performance Points (OPP) framework gets new DT
bindings and debugfs support.

A new cpufreq driver for ST platforms is added and the ACPI
driver for AMD SoCs will now support the APM X-Gene ACPI I2C
device.

The rest is mostly fixes and cleanups all over.

Specifics:

 - Add a debugfs-based interface for interacting with the ACPICA's
   AML debugger introduced in the previous cycle and a new user
   space tool for that, fix some bugs related to the AML debugger
   and clean up the code in question (Lv Zheng, Dan Carpenter,
   Colin Ian King, Markus Elfring).

 - Update ACPICA to upstream revision 20151218 including a number
   of fixes and cleanups in the ACPICA core (Bob Moore, Lv Zheng,
   Labbe Corentin, Prarit Bhargava, Colin Ian King, David E Box,
   Rafael Wysocki).

   In particular, the previously added erroneous support for the
   _SUB object is dropped, the concatenate operator will support
   all ACPI objects now, the Debug Object handling is improved,
   the SuperName handling of parameters being control methods is
   fixed, the ObjectType operator handling is updated to follow
   ACPI 5.0A and the handling of CondRefOf and RefOf is updated
   accordingly, module-level code will be executed after loading
   each ACPI table now (instead of being run once after all tables
   containing AML have been loaded), the Operation Region handlers
   management is updated to fix some reported problems and a the
   ACPICA code in the kernel is more in line with the upstream
   now.

 - Update the ACPI backlight driver to provide information on
   whether or not it will generate key-presses for brightness
   change hotkeys and update some platform drivers (dell-wmi,
   thinkpad_acpi) to use that information to avoid sending double
   key-events to users pace for these, add new ACPI backlight
   quirks (Hans de Goede, Aaron Lu, Adrien Schildknecht).

 - Improve the ACPI handling of interrupt GPIOs (Christophe Ricard).

 - Fix the handling of the list of device IDs of device objects
   found in the ACPI namespace and add a helper for checking if
   there is a device object for a given device ID (Lukas Wunner).

 - Change the logic in the ACPI namespace scanning code to create
   struct acpi_device objects for all ACPI device objects found in
   the namespace even if _STA fails for them which helps to avoid
   device enumeration problems on Microsoft Surface 3 (Aaron Lu).

 - Add support for the APM X-Gene ACPI I2C device to the ACPI
   driver for AMD SoCs (Loc Ho).

 - Fix the long-standing issue with the DMA controller on Intel
   SoCs where ACPI tables have no power management support for
   the DMA controller itself, but it can be powered off automatically
   when the last (other) device on the SoC is powered off via ACPI
   and clean up the ACPI driver for Intel SoCs (acpi-lpss) after
   previous attempts to fix that problem (Andy Shevchenko).

 - Assorted ACPI fixes and cleanups (Andy Lutomirski, Colin Ian King,
   Javier Martinez Canillas, Ken Xue, Mathias Krause, Rafael Wysocki,
   Sinan Kaya).

 - Update the device properties framework for better handling of
   built-in properties, add support for built-in properties to
   the platform bus type, update the MFD subsystem's handling
   of device properties and add support for passing default
   configuration data as device properties to the intel-lpss MFD
   drivers, convert the designware I2C driver to use the unified
   device properties API and add a fallback mechanism for using
   default built-in properties if the platform firmware fails
   to provide the properties as expected by drivers (Andy Shevchenko,
   Mika Westerberg, Heikki Krogerus, Andrew Morton).

 - Add new Device Tree bindings to the Operating Performance Points
   (OPP) framework and update the exynos4412 DT binding accordingly,
   introduce debugfs support for the OPP framework (Viresh Kumar,
   Bartlomiej Zolnierkiewicz).

 - Migrate the mt8173 cpufreq driver to the new OPP bindings
   (Pi-Cheng Chen).

 - Update the cpufreq core to make the handling of governors
   more efficient, especially on systems where policy objects
   are shared between multiple CPUs (Viresh Kumar, Rafael Wysocki).

 - Fix cpufreq governor handling on configurations with
   CONFIG_HZ_PERIODIC set (Chen Yu).

 - Clean up the cpufreq core code related to the boost sysfs knob
   support and update the ACPI cpufreq driver accordingly (Rafael
   Wysocki).

 - Add a new cpufreq driver for ST platforms and corresponding
   Device Tree bindings (Lee Jones).

 - Update the intel_pstate driver to allow the P-state selection
   algorithm used by it to depend on the CPU ID of the processor it
   is running on, make it use a special P-state selection algorithm
   (with an IO wait time compensation tweak) on Atom CPUs based on
   the Airmont and Silvermont cores so as to reduce their energy
   consumption and improve intel_pstate documentation (Philippe
   Longepe, Srinivas Pandruvada).

 - Update the cpufreq-dt driver to support registering cooling
   devices that use the (P * V^2 * f) dynamic power draw formula
   where V is the voltage, f is the frequency and P is a constant
   coefficient provided by Device Tree and update the arm_big_little
   cpufreq driver to use that support (Punit Agrawal).

 - Assorted cpufreq driver (cpufreq-dt, qoriq, pcc-cpufreq,
   blackfin-cpufreq) updates (Andrzej Hajda, Hongtao Jia,
   Jacob Tanenbaum, Markus Elfring).

 - cpuidle core tweaks related to polling and measured_us
   calculation (Rik van Riel).

 - Removal of modularity from a few cpuidle drivers (clps711x,
   ux500, exynos) that cannot be built as modules in practice
   (Paul Gortmaker).

 - PM core update to prevent devices from being probed during
   system suspend/resume which is generally problematic and may
   lead to inconsistent behavior (Grygorii Strashko).

 - Assorted updates of the PM core and related code (Julia Lawall,
   Manuel P=C3=A9gouri=C3=A9-Gonnard, Maruthi Bayyavarapu, Rafael Wysoc=
ki,
   Ulf Hansson).

 - PNP bus type updates (Christophe Le Roy, Heiner Kallweit).

 - PCI PM code cleanups (Jarkko Nikula, Julia Lawall).

 - cpupower tool updates (Jacob Tanenbaum, Thomas Renninger).

Thanks!
