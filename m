Alan, I don't know what this test means for the patch
(http://marc.info/?l=linux-pci&m=149760607914628&w=2).

pci_target_state() is documented as "return the deepest state from
which the device can generate wake events."  For this device, I guess
that means D2, and the patch should accomplish that.

I don't know what's supposed to happen to this device when the system
is in S3.  I assume that if the system is in S3, most devices are in
D3.  If this device is in D3, we won't get PMEs, which I guess is what
Kai-Heng is seeing.  Is that the desired behavior?  Or do we want the
PMEs enough that we should leave the device in D2 (if that's even
possible)?

Bjorn
