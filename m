If this fixes a BUG() that we introduced in v4.6-rc1, it sounds like we
should fix it before v4.6-final.  Please confirm.

This looks like two different bug fixes.  Can you split them into
separate patches, or is there a reason to combine them?

I would prefer if the dev_warn() made a distinction between
-EPROBE_DEFER and other failures.  It sounds like the -EPROBE_DEFER
case will happen in normal operation, and we probably shouldn't treat
it as a warning.

I assume the "pci_bus_add_devices(child)" will happen *eventually*?
Can you add a comment about when that is?
