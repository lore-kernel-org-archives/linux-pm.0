The default PCI bus pm_ops are defined in drivers/pci/pci-driver.c as
struct dev_pm_ops pci_dev_pm_ops.

I did hook into those callbacks in an earlier version of this series
but it required more patches and more modifications to the PCI core
and PCIe port services driver to get Thunderbolt runpm to work:
https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-pci/msg51158.html

Using dev_pm_domain_set() is the de facto standard to solve this,
vga_switcheroo does the same, that's why I settled on this approach.
(see drivers/gpu/vga/vga_switcheroo.c:vga_switcheroo_init_domain_pm_ops())

Not a problem.  upstream_runtime_suspend() essentially does this:

	// call pci_dev_pm_ops ->runtime_suspend hook:
	ret = dev->bus->pm->runtime_suspend(dev);
	// power down:
	acpi_execute_simple_method(power->set, NULL, 0)
	// enable wake interrupt:
	acpi_enable_gpe(NULL, power->wake_gpe)

So any changes to the pci_dev_pm_ops are inherited.  Again,
vga_switcheroo does the same (see vga_switcheroo_runtime_suspend()).

See above, the device name is included in pr_fmt.  The reason to use
pr_err() instead of dev_err() is to get the error message prefixed
with "thunderbolt" instead of "pcieport".  Recall that this function
is executed in the context of the upstream bridge, whose driver name
is pcieport.  I would like to prevent people from grepping the portdrv
code for the error message.  You're the second person to raise this
question (Andy Shevchenko made the same comment on an earlier version
of this patch), so I've now added a comment to explain it.

Good point.

Thanks,
