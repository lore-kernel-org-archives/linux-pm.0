@Ingo: Can you queue up 1/3, it's an independent fix.

Yes it should get renamed to not show:
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpuidle/state0/name
C0
This is wrong and confusing

As long as it stays a kernel and perf processor_idle internal number
it does not hurt.
But userspace tools catching the perf idle event of state 0 should never
refer to it as processor idle state 0 (or even worse C0).
Instead they should try to get the name/description of:
/sys/../state0/name
or directly refer to it as "poll idle" state.

Processor idle state C0 is not only defined as "not being idle" in the
specs, also turbostat and cpufreq-aperf use it correctly and refer to C0 when 
they show accounted "not idle" time.

Encouraged by your suggestions I send another version.
It's not a big deal to send 0xFFFFFFFF instead of 0 as "non power saving" 
state. If you can handle compatibility with it in powertop, it doesn't make 
things more complicated in kernel and perf timechart as I first thought it 
does.
