Thanks for keeping this thread up and fixing it. Some requests to this
patch too as follows.

I think this change in expectation should probably be documented under
Documentation/ directory. Can you please patch thermal documentation
too?

This message needs to be specific to thermal (forced) shutdown.

Same here..

also, I think if your system reached this point, we should probably be more
dramatic at the kernel log a scream louder, I would say a big farty WARN
to say the least. Or a crash.

the above is probably a quirk?
