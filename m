We'd had this discussion before... cf. eg.
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.input/9266/focus=9767

The problem was that several processes may have a device open, while
another process should be able to control the state of the device.
Maybe this could be solved by making the controlling process a proxy,
and having all "user" processes going though it.  Then the controlling
(proxy) process could open/close the device as it wants, letting the
runtime PM do its job.  But this would mean duplicating some kernel
functionality (at least multiplexing) in user space.
