Yes that also covers the case of 100% DT clocks and 0% /lib/firmware
clocks if somebody wants that. But most usable combination would be:

1. Parent clocks allocated by the driver

2. Timer, serial, MMC, Ethernet and whatever is needed for mounting root
   clocks defined in DT

3. The rest of the clocs loaded from /lib/firmware

Yes we want to get rid of the large amounts of static data in the
kernel. It's just a constant source for flames, and I'm getting pretty
tired of that. We already did that with pinctrl-single.c for the mux
data, so it's cleary doable even with more complex data such as the
clock data or hwmod data.

BTW, regarding the legacy mux data, although we have not yet been able
to remove the legacy mux data, we have am33xx already using it, and can
drop the omap4 legacy mux data probably for v3.11.

Yes agreed, Roger's approach is a good first step. It just needs to
be a proper device driver under drivers/clock/omap. Also note that
the /lib/firmware part is an additional step to the DT defined clocks,
but might actually make it easier to implement various PM related bits
than trying to map them as DT properties.
