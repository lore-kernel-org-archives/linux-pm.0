So currently, AFAIK, only Synaptics (rmi4) and Elantech are using
SMBus Host Notify.
So this patch would prevent the same bugs for those 2 vendors, which is good.

It took me some time to understand why this would be less than a hack.
And indeed, given that Host Notify relies on the I2C connection to be
ready for the IRQ, we can not put the controller in suspend like we do
for others where the IRQ controller is still ready.

So yes, that could work from me. Not sure what Wolfram and Jean would
say though.

Oops, yes, that one, sorry :)
