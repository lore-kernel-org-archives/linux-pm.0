More generically: ...depending on variety of factors.

It is all additional data per OPP. Additional different information is
of course for different problems. That doesn't mean we need different
solutions.

They may have nothing to do with each other, but they all have to do
with the OPP binding. If we're going to change/extend the binding,
then all issues need to be taken into account.

Agreed, but I'm not convinced how different SOCs determine valid OPPs
is common enough. Certainly how to mark an entry disabled is common
though.

We're always going to have some platform code. I'm not saying you have
to in this case. I'm saying either come up with an OPP binding
addressing all these issues or live with the existing one and fix it
up in the kernel or bootloader.

The burden has to be somewhere. Maintaining a binding forever in the
kernel is a burden as well if it is poorly designed.

Valid OPPs are not going to just be random. There's probably on a few
combinations and they'll be based on part# or speed grade or something
(which in turn defines the efuses in your case). While a dev board may
have random parts on it, an actual product would not. I could argue
that your DTB just needs to be correct to begin with for a given
part/design. Obviously, managing minor differences in a DTB like this
can be a pain. This is why firmware or bootloaders do adjustments to
the DTB at runtime and it is quite common.

What if the decision is not based on a single register bit? Perhaps
efuses are not directly memory mapped. Maybe it is based on Si
revision. Or you need to limit frequency because a certain board can't
supply adequate current. You call this generic, but it is not. It
doesn't even solve the part that is generic which is marking some OPPs
disabled.
