Yes I have been looking in usb-next.

OK.  I saw "[PATCH 09/10] usb: expose usb port's pm qos flags to user=20
space" now.

OK.

I see, I never met them before now is the reason ^^.  You're right it's=
=20
already in struct device too, and it's much more plumbed into the futur=
e=20
apis than what I have been doing.  I'll study how to change what I have=
=20
to fit this and do so.

Currently what I have (this is before changing it to pm domain, but thi=
s=20
should be unchanged) lets the asset define a callback op which will=20
receive notifications for all added child devices that have the device=20
the asset is bound to as an ancestor.

So you would bind an asset to the host controller device...

static struct device_asset assets_ehci_omap0[] =3D {
	{
                 .name =3D "-0:1.0/port1",
                 .asset =3D assets_ehci_omap0_smsc_port,
                 .ops =3D &device_descendant_attach_default_asset_ops,
	},
         { }
};

=2E..with this descendant filter callback pointing to a generic "end of=
=20
the device path" matcher.

when device_descendant_attach_default_asset_ops() sees the child that=20
was foretold has appeared (and it only hears about children of=20
ehci-omap.0 in this case), it binds the assets pointed to by .asset to=20
the new child before its probe.  assets_ehci_omap0_smsc_port is an arra=
y=20
of the actual regulator and clock that need switching by the child.  So=
=20
the effect is to magic the right assets to the child device just before=
=20
it gets added (and probe called etc).

This is working well and the matcher helper is small and simple.

It's looking good to me.
