In current kernel design, The crc32 is only for the LZO in-kernel
hibernate, doesn't apply to non-compress hibernate and userspace
hibernate.

Put signature to snapshot header can support any kind of caller that's
trigger hibernate. Any userspace hibernate tool will take the snapshot
image from kernel, so, we need put the signature(or hash result) to
snapshot header before userspace write it to anywhere.=20

That speed of hash is calculated from non-compress snapshot image, does
not overlap with crc32.

The HMAC approach will not encrypt, just put the key of HMAC to boottim=
e
variable.=20

If user doesn't enable UEFI secure boot, that's fine, the key of HMAC
still cannot access in OS runtime.=20
If user enable UEFI secure boot, then that's better! Because all EFI
file will signed by the manufacturers or OSVs to make sure the code is
secure, will not pass the key to runtime.


Thanks a lot!
