Let me elaborate.

My general goal is that I want to make it easier (or as easy as
possible) for the general driver author to deploy runtime PM and
system-wide PM support - in an optimized manner. Therefore, I am
pondering over the solution you picked in this series, trying to
understand how it fits into those aspects.

Particular I am a bit worried from a complexity point of view, about
the part with skipping callbacks from the PM core. We have observed
some difficulties with the direct_complete path (i2c dw driver), which
is based on a similar approach as this one.

Additionally, in this case, to trigger skipping of callbacks to
happen, first, drivers needs to inform the middle-layer, second, the
middle layer acts on that information and then informs the PM core,
then in the third step, the PM core can decide what to do. It doesn't
sound straight-forward.

I guess I need to be convinced that this new approach is going to be
better than the the direct_complete path, so it somehow can replace it
along the road. Otherwise, we may end up just having yet another way
of skipping callbacks in the PM core and I don't like that.

Of course, I also realize this hole thing is opt-in, so nothing will
break and we are all good. :-)

Well, to me it's useful because it shows how these flags can/will be used.

Anyway, I thought you scraped that patch and was working on a new
version. I will have a look then.

Yep.

My point is, it's isn't obvious why you need to make sure the device's
runtime PM status is set to "RPM_SUSPENDED" when leaving the resume
noirq phase. You did explain that somewhat above, thanks!

Perhaps you could fold in some of that information into the doc as well?

What do you mean by "failures of that are meaningless here."?

I was suggesting, instead of calling pm_runtime_set_suspended() in the
noirq *resume* phase, why can't you do that in the noirq *suspend*
phase?

In the noirq *suspend* phase it's not too late to deal with errors!? Or is it?
