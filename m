I guess this is a pretty generic problem that could affect any device
that shares an IRQ.

I think I'll queue this on my pci/pm branch, since it seems closely
related to Mika's "PCI: Add runtime PM support for PCIe ports".

Did you check for the same issue in other likely places, e.g., AER,
PME, etc.?
