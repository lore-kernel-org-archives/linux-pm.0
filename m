Having considered that a bit more I see that, in fact, commit
e8665002477f0278f84f898145b1f141ba26ee26 (PM: Allow pm_runtime_suspend() to
succeed during system suspend) has introduced at least one regression.
Namely, the PCI bus type runs pm_runtime_resume() in its .prepare()
callback to guarantee that devices will be in a well known state before
the PCI .suspend() and .suspend_noirq() callbacks are executed.
Unfortunately, after commit e8665002477f0278f84f898145b1f141ba26ee26 this
isn't valid any more, because devices can be runtime-suspend after the
pm_runtime_resume() in .prepare() has run.

USB seems to do something similar in choose_wakeup().

So, either the both of these subsystems should be modified to use
pm_runtime_get_sync() and then pm_runtime_put_<something>() some time
during resume, or we should revert commit e8665002477f0278f84f898145b1f141ba26ee26.

Quite frankly, which shouldn't be a surprise to anyone at this point, I'd
prefer to revert that commit for 3.0.

Thanks,
Rafael
