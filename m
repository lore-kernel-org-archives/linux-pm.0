Of course it's true.  Just ask Arve -- he wants opportunistic suspend 
and it _is_ a variant of forced suspend.  Ergo he wants a new type of 
forced suspend.

Maybe that's not what he _ought_ to want.  Nevertheless, there are 
valid reasons for wanting it.

Currently we use the freezer.  But it is a blunt tool -- it freezes 
every user process.  Also, it doesn't actually make processes 
unrunnable; it just arranges things so that when they do run, they 
immediately put themselves back to sleep.

And the forced-suspend design relies on the fact that processes remain 
frozen throughout.  If we leave some processes unfrozen and one of them 
somehow becomes runnable, that means we have to abort the forced 
suspend before the process is allowed to run.
