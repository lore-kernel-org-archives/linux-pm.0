So how should changes to drivers/thunderbolt/ be merged in the future?

Andreas could probably send pulls directly to Linus, but I'm not sure
what the requirements are. I believe Linus wants signed tags. The trust
path from Linus to me is 4 hops and I've signed Andreas' key today,
yielding a 5 hop trust path:
http://pgp.cs.uu.nl/mk_path.cgi?FROM=0x79BE3E4300411886&TO=0x2AAF22EB
http://pgp.surfnet.nl:11371/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0xB1FCD9A3

Is there an upper limit on the acceptable length of the trust path?
Does the key have to be signed by another maintainer?

I guess the alternative would be that Greg KH picks up the patches,
as he did with the initial version of the Thunderbolt driver back in
2014. I'm not sure if that makes sense as I assume he has numerous
other things on his plate. (Which is not to belittle your own or
Linus' workload.)

Most subsystems seem to practice a four-eyes principle, i.e. a
Reviewed-by should be provided by someone else if author and committer
are the same person. I'll be glad to provide that for Andreas' own
patches such as 2ffa9a5d76a7, or help otherwise if I can.


As concerns this particular series, 10 of the 13 patches, i.e. the
majority, concern the PCI core, 1 concerns the PM core and only 2
concern the Thunderbolt driver. Since the PCI core is generally seeing
a lot more activity than the Thunderbolt driver, the probability of
merge conflicts is much higher if this series is merged through a
different tree than yours. It seems to be common practice to just
accept an Acked-by from other subsystem maintainers as a green light
to merge without looking closer at those patches.


I agree with your assessment that the lack of public documentation on
Thunderbolt is deplorable. However the PCIe spec does define what a
PCIe switch is and how it functions, and Thunderbolt is precisely that.
I.e. it documents a portion of Thunderbolt without ever saying so
explicitly.

You cite the lack of a public spec as a reason for unmaintainability,
yet your subsystem contains code to support Thunderbolt on non-Macs,
in the form of acpiphp. Was the maintainability argument ever mounted
against acpiphp? Intel engineers with access to the spec contributed
the changes for acpiphp to make Thunderbolt work on non-Macs. Is their
code more maintainable than reverse-engineered code?

Best regards,

Lukas
