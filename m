No, it is more accurate to say "PCI devices".

Well, it actually gets somewhat confusing, because in the PCI
terminology a "PCI device" means a physical piece of hardware that can
be put into a single "slot" (think socket on a board) and may consist
up to 8 functional units called "functions" which are each represented
by a struct pci_dev.  So there may be up to 8 struct pci_dev objects
per "PCI device" (as per the standard language) and, BTW, drivers bind
to functions (via the struct pci_dev objects).

Now, WAKE# is shared by all functions within the same "PCI device"
(I'm not sure if the standard specifies that directly, but at least it
appears to be treated as an obvious physical limitation), so it may be
useful to represent the "slot" or "device" level in the DT even though
it has no struct device based representation in the kernel.
