Hi Linus,

This goes early, because I'm attending the LCA next week and I may be
sparsely available and generally time-constrained during the next
several days.

In case you decide to open the 4.16 merge window any time soon, please
pull from the tag

 Merge branches 'pm-opp', 'pm-devfreq', 'pm-avs' and 'pm-tools'

on top of commit a8750ddca918032d6349adbf9a4b6555e7db20da

 Linux 4.15-rc8

to receive power management updates for 4.16-rc1.

This includes some infrastructure changes in the PM core, mostly
related to integration between runtime PM and system-wide suspend
and hibernation, plus some driver changes depending on them and
fixes for issues in that area which have become quite apparent
recently.

Also included are changes making more x86-based systems use the Low
Power Sleep S0 _DSM interface by default, which turned out to be
necessary to handle power button wakeups from suspend-to-idle on
Surface Pro3.

On the cpufreq front we have fixes and cleanups in the core, some
new hardware support, driver updates and the removal of some unused
code from the CPU cooling thermal driver.

Apart from this, the Operating Performance Points (OPP) framework
is prepared to be used with power domains in the future and there
is a usual bunch of assorted fixes and cleanups.

Specifics:

 - Define a PM driver flag allowing drivers to request that their
   devices be left in suspend after system-wide transitions to the
   working state if possible and add support for it to the PCI bus
   type and the ACPI PM domain (Rafael Wysocki).

 - Make the PM core carry out optimizations for devices with driver
   PM flags set in some cases and make a few drivers set those flags
   (Rafael Wysocki).

 - Fix and clean up wrapper routines allowing runtime PM device
   callbacks to be re-used for system-wide PM, change the generic
   power domains (genpd) framework to stop using those routines
   incorrectly and fix up a driver depending on that behavior of
   genpd (Rafael Wysocki, Ulf Hansson, Geert Uytterhoeven).

 - Fix and clean up the PM core's device wakeup framework and
   re-factor system-wide PM core code related to device wakeup
   (Rafael Wysocki, Ulf Hansson, Brian Norris).

 - Make more x86-based systems use the Low Power Sleep S0 _DSM
   interface by default (to fix power button wakeup from
   suspend-to-idle on Surface Pro3) and add a kernel command line
   switch to tell it to ignore the system sleep blacklist in the
   ACPI core (Rafael Wysocki).

 - Fix a race condition related to cpufreq governor module removal
   and clean up the governor management code in the cpufreq core
   (Rafael Wysocki).

 - Drop the unused generic code related to the handling of the static
   power energy usage model in the CPU cooling thermal driver along
   with the corresponding documentation (Viresh Kumar).

 - Add mt2712 support to the Mediatek cpufreq driver (Andrew-sh Cheng).

 - Add a new operating point to the imx6ul and imx6q cpufreq drivers
   and switch the latter to using clk_bulk_get() (Anson Huang, Dong
   Aisheng).

 - Add support for multiple regulators to the TI cpufreq driver along
   with a new DT binding related to that and clean up that driver
   somewhat (Dave Gerlach).

 - Fix a powernv cpufreq driver regression leading to incorrect CPU
   frequency reporting, fix that driver to deal with non-continguous
   P-states correctly and clean it up (Gautham Shenoy, Shilpasri Bhat).

 - Add support for frequency scaling on Armada 37xx SoCs through the
   generic DT cpufreq driver (Gregory CLEMENT).

 - Fix error code paths in the mvebu cpufreq driver (Gregory CLEMENT).

 - Fix a transition delay setting regression in the longhaul cpufreq
   driver (Viresh Kumar).

 - Add Skylake X (server) support to the intel_pstate cpufreq driver
   and clean up that driver somewhat (Srinivas Pandruvada).

 - Clean up the cpufreq statistics collection code (Viresh Kumar).

 - Drop cluster terminology and dependency on physical_package_id
   from the PSCI driver and drop dependency on arm_big_little from
   the SCPI cpufreq driver (Sudeep Holla).

 - Add support for system-wide suspend and resume to the RAPL power
   capping driver and drop a redundant semicolon from it (Zhen Han,
   Luis de Bethencourt).

 - Make SPI domain validation (in the SCSI SPI transport driver) and
   system-wide suspend mutually exclusive as they rely on the same
   underlying mechanism and cannot be carried out at the same time
   (Bart Van Assche).

 - Fix the computation of the amount of memory to preallocate in the
   hibernation core and clean up one function in there (Rainer Fiebig,
   Kyungsik Lee).

 - Prepare the Operating Performance Points (OPP) framework for being
   used with power domains and clean up one function in it (Viresh
   Kumar, Wei Yongjun).

 - Clean up the generic sysfs interface for device PM (Andy Shevchenko).

 - Fix several minor issues in power management frameworks and clean
   them up a bit (Arvind Yadav, Bjorn Andersson, Geert Uytterhoeven,
   Gustavo Silva, Julia Lawall, Luis de Bethencourt, Paul Gortmaker,
   Sergey Senozhatsky, gaurav jindal).

 - Make it easier to disable PM via Kconfig (Mark Brown).

 - Clean up the cpupower and intel_pstate_tracer utilities (Doug
   Smythies, Laura Abbott).

Thanks!
