Hi Linus,

Please pull from the tag

 git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rafael/linux-pm.git \
 pm-4.18-rc4

with top-most commit 88b96088e94ec66f6c9015eee28cb9d053be69c0

 Merge branch 'pm-pci'

on top of commit 021c91791a5e7e85c567452f1be3e4c2c6cb6063

 Linux 4.18-rc3

to receive power management fixes for 4.18-rc4.

These fix a PCI power management regression introduced during the
4.17 cycle and fix up the recently added support for devices in
multiple power domains.

Specifics:

 - Resume parallel PCI (non-PCIe) bridges on suspend-to-RAM (ACP S3)
   to avoid confusing the platform firmware which started to happen
   after a core power management regression fix that went in during
   the 4.17 cycle (Rafael Wysocki).

 - Fix up the recently added support for devices in multiple power
   domains by avoiding to power up the entire domain unnecessarily
   when attaching a device to it (Ulf Hansson).

Thanks!

      PCI / ACPI / PM: Resume bridges w/o drivers on suspend-to-RAM

Ulf Hansson (1):
      PM / Domains: Don't power on at attach for the multi PM domain case
