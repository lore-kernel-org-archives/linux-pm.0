The question is not whether they can be solved _somehow_, but whether it is
_sufficiently_ _convenient_ to solve them using the existing interfaces.

It seems to me that for some devices it might be more convenient to have
an "execute pm_runtime_idle() for this device right now" sysfs trigger
(and analogously for resume).

Anyway, please note that the scenario in which the driver detects inactivity
and suspends the device in response is not the only one possible.  The other
one is that the driver is told to suspend the device and then blocks apps
wanting to access it until resumed.  Right now we have interfaces for the
former, but not for the latter.

Not necessarily.

For the second scenario above to be possible.
