But runtime-pm.txt says for example:

    Generally, remote wake-up should be enabled for all input devices
    put into a low power state at run time.

But in this case the requirement is to suppress input events from a
given device, effectively muting and putting it into low power state,
even though it's still open by some other parties.  Runtime PM, on the
other hand tries not to interfere with the normal usage of the device.

Later:

(3) ->runtime_idle() and ->runtime_suspend() can only be executed for a
    device the usage counter of which is equal to zero _and_ [...]

which underlines the difference again: the usage counter (defined by
common sense) won't be zero in our case, because the device is
constantly kept open, while we want to mute it, putting it into a low
power state.  Probably, the rules could be bent so that the platform bus
could suspend these devices and achieve our aim, but I'd consider that
an abuse of the runtime PM infrastructure.  Don't you?

Actually, this could be implemented by the various users cooperating in
closing the device, letting it go to sleep automatically.  But this
requires strictly cooperating parties and is more complicated that
flipping some master switch of the device.  We're looking for this
master switch, before needlessly building our own.

We're also looking for a framework to implement it in.  Now I feel like
the runtime PM framework is not a good fit for what we want, but it's
the first time I'm reading its documentation, so please correct my
misunderstandings.  That's why I cross posted linux-pm, after all. :)
