This is a totally made-up argument in this particular case.

Both of the functions in question are 1 screen long and you can *see* what
happens in there without even scrolling them.

Second, the subsequent patch actually *does* add a label to one of the without
renamling the existing one or such.

"out" pretty much represents the purpose of the goto in both cases and making
the label longer doesn't make it any better.
