Precisely.  But my question was more about how we are going to indicate it
to the driver writers (who may not be familiar with that subsystem to start
with and may have experience with some other subsystems that don't use
these new functions) that they are not supposed to populate .suspend_late
and .resume_early.

Well, that's supposed to be a subsystem-level callback.

Anyway, my personal opinion is that we seem to be adding confusion instead of
reducing it here ...
