What do you consider disruptive? Disabling active interrupts? Stopping
the monotonic clock?

They may not be based on hardware that can get to the same power mode
from idle as suspend. This could be acpi based hardware, it could be
like the hardware we started with that did not have regular timers
that could run in the low power mode, or devices could loose their
state in the lowest power mode.

I think using suspend is much simpler. It avoids having to worry about
dependencies between processes.

You do not need to sprinkle suspend blocker all over the distro for it
to be useful. You can convert the existing auto-suspend code to use
opportunistic suspend and all apps that don't use suspend blocker will
behave as they do today while allowing apps to use suspend blockers to
keep the system running after the auto-suspend timeout expired.
