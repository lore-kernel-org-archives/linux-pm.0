The lspci output [1] shows:

  00:12.0 USB controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD] FCH USB EHCI Controller (rev 39) (prog-if 20 [EHCI])
    Capabilities: [c0] Power Management version 2
      Flags: PMEClk- DSI- D1+ D2+ AuxCurrent=0mA PME(D0+,D1+,D2+,D3hot+,D3cold+)
      Status: D3 NoSoftRst- PME-Enable+ DSel=0 DScale=0 PME-
      Bridge: PM- B3+

The device claims it can assert PME# from D3hot.  If it can't, that
sounds like a hardware defect that should be addressed with a quirk.
Ideally we would also have a pointer to the AMD hardware erratum.

Is the following path involved here?

  pci_finish_runtime_suspend
    target_state = pci_target_state()
      if (device_may_wakup())
	if (dev->pme_support)
	  ...
    pci_set_power_state(..., target_state)

If so, I would naively expect that a quirk could clear the
PCI_PM_CAP_PME_D3 and PCI_PM_CAP_PME_D3cold bits in dev->pme_support,
and pci_target_state() would then avoid selecting D3 or D3cold.  But
I'm not an expert in power management.
