Yes, I like this direction better.  Thanks for reworking and thanks for
the thorough changelog.

And thanks also for the broad testing.

One nit about the test report/coverage is I don't see any
test/verification that the voltage is still being scaled based on the DT
based OPPs.  It's easy to verify at least from the regulator PoV that
the voltage is scaled also.

My dumb DVFS test script (below) should work on any busybox rootfs 

Care to give that (or something like it) a try as well?  

With that extra confirmation of testing, I will queue up this series.

Thanks,

Kevin
