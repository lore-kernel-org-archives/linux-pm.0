Yep, exactly.

OTOH since it exports information we can do disciplined versioning and 
extensions only - i.e. leave the old power events around, add the new 
ones with new distinct names, and phase out the old ones in a kernel 
cycle or two. It's not hard to do.

That way apps can support old kernels too (if they want to), but new 
events as well - and all in a controlled, non-disruptive manner.

More importantly, the kernel wont have cruft and will have no ABI 
restrictions - the only 'restriction' is to treat information in an 
append-only manner (i.e. change the event name if you change it 
materially) - and that's not a big deal here.

The fundamental thing about tracing/instrumentation is that there are no 
deep ABI needs: it's all about analyzing development kernels (and a few 
select versions that get the enterprise treatment) but otherwise the 
half-life of this kind of information is very short.

So we dont want to tie ourselves down with excessive ABIs.

That's most definitely so! There is and will be zero back-coupling from 
workqueue tracepoints to workqueue internals. Dont worry about this.
