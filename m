So the problem I have is that you first introduce uclamp_se::value and
use that all over the code, and then introduce effective and change all
the usage sites.

That seems daft. Why not keep all the code as-is and add orig_value.

It's weird though. Esp. when combined with that mapping logic, because
then you get to use additional maps that are not in fact ever used.

OK. So mostly my complaint is that it seems to do things odd for ill
explained reasons.
