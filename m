Thank you, I hadn't thought of PM notifiers.

That would indeed be a viable alternative solution:
- Call pcie_disable_notification() on PM_SUSPEND_PREPARE /
  PM_HIBERNATION_PREPARE.
- Run the code in pciehp_resume() on PM_POST_SUSPEND / PM_POST_HIBERNATION.
  (This includes pcie_enable_notification(). The pciehp_suspend() and
  pciehp_resume() could be dropped completely.)

Bjorn, please let me know if you'd prefer that in favor of the patch below.
(The portion which replaces the BUG_ON would still be needed though.)

Thanks,

Lukas
