I don't understand this.  Why wouldn't the parent be in RPM_ACTIVE at
this time?  After all, how could the system be expected to resume a
child device if its parent wasn't fully active?

In general, during a system resume callback we should bring a device
back to full power, tell the PM core that this has been done, and leave
it at full power until the whole system resume is finished.  For
efficiency we can avoid doing this in cases where the device was in
runtime suspend before the system suspend began, but you have to be
very careful about it -- see the documentation for the ->prepare
callback in Documentation/driver-api/pm/devices.rst.
