Linux v4.8 added support to runtime suspend PCIe ports to D3hot.

Patches 1 to 6 of this series apply high gloss polish to that code to
speed it up, reduce its size and improve its readability.  None of these
patches should result in a functional change.  (And they didn't in my
tests.)

Patches 7 and 8 are cleanups / refactorings for acpiphp.  They're prep
work for patch 9 and likewise shouldn't cause a functional change.

Patch 9 extends runtime PM support to hotplug ports.


@Keith Busch: I seem to recall you're working with large arrays of NVMe
drives connected to native PCIe hotplug ports.  Perhaps you could give
this series a spin, it might save quite a bit of power.

To ease reviewing I've pushed this series to GitHub:

Thanks,

Lukas


Lukas Wunner (9):
  PCI: Don't acquire ref on parent in pci_bridge_d3_update()
  PCI: Autosense device removal in pci_bridge_d3_update()
  PCI: Speed up algorithm in pci_bridge_d3_update()
  PCI: Activate runtime PM on a PCIe port only if it can suspend
  PCI: Consolidate conditions to allow runtime PM on PCIe ports
  PCI: Unfold conditions to block runtime PM on PCIe ports
  ACPI / hotplug / PCI: Use cached copy of PCI_EXP_SLTCAP_HPC bit
  ACPI / hotplug / PCI: Make device_is_managed_by_native_pciehp() public
  PCI: pciehp: Add runtime PM support for PCIe hotplug ports
