The original idea was to allow suspend and resume to be carried out
with interrupts off, not necessarily by interrupt handlers.  We've never
considered doing that with _idle before.

Why do they need the _sync versions?  What exactly is wrong with
calling

pm_runtime_put_noidle()
pm_runtime_suspend()

from an interrupt handler if it really wants the synchronous suspend to be
carried out at this point?

I don't really see a reason for calling pm_runtime_put_sync() by an interrupt
handler, but perhaps I'm overlooking something important.

Yes, I am.  Although simply calling pm_runtime_put() should work as well (yes,
the suspend won't occur immediately, but what's wrong with that?).

That also would work for me, actually.

Because it's a fragile design with unusual behavior.  I'm pretty sure we'd see
some interesting abuse of it sooner or later. :-)

Thanks,
