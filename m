Yes, but you know how many mA you are taking just now. So if you knew
the internal resistance, you could compute the voltage at 0
current. (And it should also work during charging, as long as you know
how much current is going in.)

Yes, and that coefficient should be internal battery resistance ;-).

Well.. One set of coefficients would be kind of ok. But you are doing
two, because it really depends on current, not charge/discharge. So
why not do it right, for all currents...?

Yes, but there's very different current during "idle" phone and during
call (for example). So yes, you are compensating for different current
during charge and discharge, but it is possible to do better.

I think so, yes, because otherwise you need a set of tables for each
machine.
