It's OK because SCM window is statically mapped to the same virtual address=
. But the problem is that SMP memory window isn't protected. I'm not sure w=
hether it's possible to protect SCM window using this approach.

t's OK because SCM window is statically mapped. So each call of ioremap in =

Just to be clear, what I was proposing is to have each driver taking
care of its own io window.

For instance, for BG, assuming we have a DT like this:

		ctrl_module_core: ctrl_module_core@4a002000 {
			compatible =3D "ti,omap4-control";
			ti,hwmods =3D "ctrl_module_core";
			#address-cells =3D <1>;
			#size-cells =3D <1>;
			ranges;
			bandgap: bandgap@4a002000 {
				 reg =3D <0x4a00232C 0x4 0x4a002378 0x18>;
				 compatible =3D "ti,omap4460-bandgap";
				 interrupts =3D <0 126 4>; /* talert */
				 ti,tshut-gpio =3D <86>; /* tshut */
			 };
			usb {
				compatible =3D "ti,omap4-usb-phy";
			};
		};

then, while probing, it can request those by simply:

	i =3D 0;
	do {
		void __iomem *chunk;

		res =3D platform_get_resource(pdev, IORESOURCE_MEM, i);
		if (!res)
			break;
		chunk =3D devm_request_and_ioremap(&pdev->dev, res);
		if (i =3D=3D 0)
			bg_ptr->base =3D chunk;
		if (!chunk) {
			dev_err(&pdev->dev,
				"failed to request the IO (%d:%pR).\n",
				i, res);
			return ERR_PTR(-EADDRNOTAVAIL);
		}
		i++;
	} while (res);

The driver needs to adapt its reg offsets, of course, it is doable and
with the current design it is just a matter of redefining the register
offsets.

But for the above to work, the core driver must not request the
complete IO area.
