Hi,


The patchset merges max77843 regulator driver into max77693.
I am asking for review and acks from multiple subsystems.


Rationale
=========
The recently added max77843 regulator driver is very similar to
its older brother: the max77693. Both devices provide two safeouts
and a charger.

The main difference is in charger's output capabilities and related
registry values.

With some code additions the max77693 regulator driver can support both
chipsets. This reduces overall code duplication and is a first step
toward integrating other drivers for these devices.


Patchset description
====================
Patches 1-3 do various cleanup.
Patch 4 prepare max77694 regulator driver for supporting different
devices.
Patch 5 switch max77693 drivers to common state container.
Patch 6 updates max77843 drivers to common state container.
Patches 7-8 do final cleanup before merging.
Patches 9-10 do the merge of max77843 regulator into max77693.


Dependencies
============
The patchset is rebased on current regulator tree:
v4.1-rc1-8-ge2a4e9538fe6. It touches all currently merged max77843
drivers: extcon, mfd, input and regulator (charger driver was not yet
merged).


Best regards,
Krzysztof
