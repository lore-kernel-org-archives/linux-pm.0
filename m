Currently it is the only way. But I agree that it could be done better.

Yes, it DOES count as a test (as strange as it may sound)! :-)

The FIPS requirements are as follows:

- raw ciphers must be subject to a FIPS test with one block chaining mode to 
cover that cipher with all block chaining modes (e.g. you can test ecb(aes) to 
cover AES with *all* existing block chaining modes).

- for compound crypto algorithm (like RSA with respect to hashes, KDF with 
respect to the keyed message digest, HMAC with respect to hashes), the 
wrapping crypto algorithm needs to be tested with *one* wrapped cipher at 
least (but also not more. E.g. if you have a self test for, say, all SHA-1 and 
SHA-2, you only need one HMAC SHA test or one KDF HMAC SHA test.

- in some circumstances, it is even permissible to test wrapping crypto 
algorithms where the underlying algo is implicitly tested. E.g. if you have a 
HMAC SHA-256 test, you do not need an individual SHA-256 test.

Do you happen to have an official SHA-512 HKDF test vector? RFC5869 only has 
SHA-1 and SHA-256 tests.

const does not work with __VECS :-(

I leave it without const at the moment. I think the __VECS should be updated 
along with all test vectors.
