Okay. How did you verify this?

I think the easiest way would be to make sure the usage count is
*one*, just before the omap_hsmmc calls mmc_add_host() in its
->probe() function.

If it's *two*, that confirms this theory.

Okay. Interesting. :-)

Only when "someone" in-before has set the autosuspend delay to a
negative value, this will affect the usage count.

I didn't find any in-kernel user that would set this for the
omap_hsmmc device, so it needs to be done from userspace via sysfs. It
would be really great if you could help to confirm this.

But more importantly, I fail to understand why commit 5de85b9d57ab
("PM / runtime: Re-init runtime PM states at probe error and driver
unbind"), is changing the behaviour in this regards.
Potentially we might have a different runtime PM status than we had
before when probing the second try, but how could that mess up the
usage count...?

So that happened before as well.

Although, we now get a different runtime PM status (suspended) the
second probe time.

Perhaps, but let's try to validate that as it should be rather easy.

Yes, there perfectly okay.

Although, I wondering whether it could be that it's the PM domain
that's preventing the omap_hsmmc device from becoming runtime
suspended.

Perhaps the PM domain returns an error code from its
->runtime_suspend() callback?

Okay, so we definitely seem to have an issue with the changed runtime
PM status (suspended) the second probe time.

That's indeed caused by 5de85b9d57ab ("PM / runtime: Re-init runtime
PM states at probe error and driver unbind").

I think it's important in this context, as it could affect how the PM
domain may treat the device. As I mentioned earlier.

For example due to commit 5de85b9d57ab ("PM / runtime: Re-init runtime
PM states at probe error and driver unbind"), the ->runtime_resume()
callback seems now to be called twice in a row, without in-between
having the ->runtime_suspend() callback being invoked. Does really the
PM domain cope with that correctly?

Oh, yes. Although I don't have an omap3, I wish I had.

Also, I have locally a "runtime PM test driver", which helps me to
test various runtime PM sequences.

Kind regards
Uffe
