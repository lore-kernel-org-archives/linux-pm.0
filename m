First of all sorry about the version log.
No these stats are not per-policy. They are per-chip. The throttle event is
common for all cores in the chip.

Yes agree that it will be much cleaner with policy->kobj. But using policy->kobj
will result in multiple copies of the throttle-chip stats exported for each
policy in the chip. And moving it to cpu/cpuX/cpufreq/stats/
will add a dependency on CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_STAT

We want throttle attributes to be either in cpu/cpufreq or cpu/cpuX/cpufreq. If
multiple copies is not an issue, then I will move it to cpu/cpuX/cpufreq.

Thanks and Regards,
