I see it as a different problem  - and one that seems to be minimally
pressing to most users jduging by the amount of noise it hasn't caused in
the past seven odd years.

This started because the Android people came to a meeting that was put
together of various folks to try and sort of the big blockage in getting
Android and Linux kernels back towards merging.

I am interested right now in finding a general solution to the Android
case and the fact it looks very similar to the VM, hard RT, gamer and
other related problems although we seem to have diverged from that logic.

I dont think it particularly useful to go off on a mostly unrelated wild
goose chase into ACPI land, especially one based on a premise of changing
all the apps when the hardware will end up fixed faster.
