I don't think the perf tools/ do it right at the moment, but here is my
proposal:

Currently, we need to do make install from the tools/ directory. Since kernel
developers are lazy, I would propose a CONFIG_INSTALL_TOOLS default N config
option that would let make install from the root of the kernel tree install the
tools too. (looking at my inbox..) As Steven just beat me to it, see his lib
versioning proposal. ;)

The library would present an API to the application that would let apps consume
specific events of interest. Translation of fixed event names/fields into the
current kernel version tracepoint names/fields would be performed by the lib,
and the library would also deal with reading the perf events through the perf
ABI and would act as a middle-man to make sure they are always perceived by the
application in the same way.

Steven's proposal should work.

I currently have a lot on my plate with trace format and ring buffer, but if
anyone is interested in trying to implement this, I can look at it and provide
feedback/hints.

Thanks,
