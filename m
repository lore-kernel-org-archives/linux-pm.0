In fact that's not quite true.  You simply weren't aware of the new
code; you can find a series of patches starting here:

	http://marc.info/?l=linux-usb&m=135314427413307&w=2

The parts of interest to us begin in patch 7/10.

It will be implemented through PM QOS.

Okay, I'm fine with tying this to the port.

If we use a PM domain then there won't be any need to hook the runtime
PM events.  The domain will automatically be notified about power
changes.

Then why not use a PM domain?  It will allow us to do whatever we want 
in the callbacks.

This is the part that Andy has been working on.  The board-dependent 
info will be registered by the board file, and it will take effect 
either when the port is registered or when it is bound to a driver.

The details of this aren't clear yet.  For instance, should the device 
core try to match the port with the asset info, or should this be done 
by the USB code when the port is created?

Even though it is overkill, it may be better than introducing a new 
abstraction.  After all, this is exactly the sort of thing that PM 
domains were originally created to handle.

Rafael, do you have any advice on this?  The generic_pm_domain 
structure is fairly complicated, there's a lot of code in 
drivers/base/power/domain.c (it's the biggest source file in its 
directory), and I'm not aware of any documentation.
