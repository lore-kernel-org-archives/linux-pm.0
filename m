I covered this in my reply to Ingo yesterday.  The result is that a
failed or unimplemented call drops through to do_exit(0) on behalf of
the calling process, terminating that process.  However, as I said
in that same email, I don't think you're getting anywhere near this
code.

Right, so things are stuck in userspace, which means the system is still
in an active runnable state.

As I mentioned (again) in my email, the issue appears to be that the 'rc'
script is stuck waiting on a FIFO.

The init daemon is trying to do an orderly shutdown.  As part of that,
it's executing the 'rc' script, which in systems I've seen, runs through
a set of scripts in the /etc/rc?.d directory in order, which normally
bring up or take down services and perform other sequenced actions.

If this script hangs (as it seems to be doing) it won't get to running
/sbin/poweroff or similar, and that means machine_power_off() won't be
called.

This suggests it could be a udev issue - but without knowing what's
happening inside sysvinit's scripts, it's hard to know for certain.
Adding some debug to the 'rc' script (make sure it works without
rebooting or changing the run level, or have a way of restoring the
file if it fails to boot) so that it's possible to see what it's doing
may be a good idea - the simplest approach may be to just add

set -x

towards the top of the file - which will make it very noisy.
