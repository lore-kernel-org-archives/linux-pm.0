They are not the same.  With a busy-wait you handle the device as soon
as possible, before the interrupt routine returns.  With a workqueue
you have to mask the entire IRQ line, possibly losing interrupt
requests from other devices, until the workqueue routine can run.

What do you guys think spin_lock() does?  It busy-waits until the lock 
is free!  If you don't like busy-waiting then you don't like spinlocks, 
and if you believe ISR's can't busy-wait then you believe they can't 
acquire spinlocks.  :-)

Really, what I'm talking about is not much different from continuing to
hold dev->power.lock across the runtime_resume and runtime_suspend
callbacks.  Would you prefer to do that instead of explicitly
busy-waiting?  There would be two disadvantages.  First, the
runtime_suspend routine would not be able to call pm_request_idle() or
pm_schedule_suspend() and then return -EBUSY.  Second, if the driver
uses a private lock then the callback routines might not be able to
acquire it.

I'm not sure what you mean.
