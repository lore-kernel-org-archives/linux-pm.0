At least there are no restriction, as I know.

True.

Correct. It was introduced long time ago (before device-links).

Correct. Sorry. My bad - it was Monday.

Again sorry for the noise.

I re-checked it on clean master (Linux 4.13-rc2) with and without your patches
and see no issues, just "runtime PM trying to suspend device but active child"
message is gone. Above test sequence still can be used without any additional patches.

So, thank you for your patches and sorry for the noise.
