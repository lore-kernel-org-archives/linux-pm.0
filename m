After doing more debugging on this it turns out that this looks like a
legacy interrupt coming in. The vector number is always 55, which is legacy
IRQ 7 as seen from the PIC. The corresponding IOAPIC interrupt pin is
masked and vector 55 is completely unused.

More questions than answers. Still investigating.
