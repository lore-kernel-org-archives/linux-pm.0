Well, in principle we could make it depend in CONFIG_ACPI or something like
this, but I'm not sure that will be well-received. :-)

In the particular case in question, though, there's some freedom.  Namely,
the hardware will work for many different QoS constraints and it's not
precisely known in principle and upfront which one would be optimal for
a given workload.

Do you know any better mechanism consistent accross all devices?
Please be specific. :-)

Well, the wakelocks example shows clearly that preventing certain interfaces
from being merged into mainline doesn't actually prevent people from using
them in actual products.  I claim it's way better if a vendor uses its
proprietary user space with the mainline kernel than if that vendor patches
the kernel and _then_ uses its proprietary user space with it.  Your
argumentation seems to suggest that we encourage the latter.

Thanks,
Rafael
