Or, if you use the convention mentioned in another message in this
thread, you can make the wakeirq be a property of a bridge (port) with
the clarification of the assumption that WAKE# is shared by all
functions below the bridge.  So the presence of the "wakeirq" property
for a bridge (in addition to providing the wakeup IRQ) will mean that
it applies to all devices below the bridge.

In the case of parallel PCI (not PCIe), there may be multiple "slots"
(or "PCI devices" consisting each of multiple functions) under one
bridge and in theory each of them may use a different IRQ for WAKE#
signaling, so the above convention will not work then.

Thanks,
Rafael
