I think it makes it less flexible to be honest. Once it's exposed to
userspace there's little we can change about it, and userspace needs
to set it up.

Yeah that's what I was getting at. It doesn't even need to be a
swapfile in the kernel, at the very least it should be named
differently to avoid confusion with actual swapfiles.

Hmm I didn't look too closely at this but I don't understand how
making it a swapfile helps with tiering? If anything, I think it makes
tiering more difficult. For tiering to work, we need an
abstraction/redirection layer, such that we don't need to update the
page tables (or shmem pagecache) if we demote/promote pages. That is
exactly the use case for a virtual swap layer. The page tables point
at a virtual swap ID and the backend could change transparently (e.g.
for zswap writeback, or tiering).

If we make the virtual layer a swapfile, how do we demote/promote
without updating page tables?

IOW, I think the whole reason we want a virtual layer is to separate
the backends, which would facilitate tiering. If the virtual layer is
itself a swapfile, wouldn't it become one of the tiers?

We don't *need* to introduce this, at least not initially. Only if we
have a good use case for it.

Right, it's not necessarily zswap at all. As I mentioned above, the
same logic applies for swap tiering. You can actually consider zswap
one of the tiers (more-or-less). If you have one swapfile (or one
tier) like the ones you mention above, the virtual layer just always
points to a single backend (e.g. the slot in the swapfile). There
might be some additional overhead, but I think it would be minimal if
we use the cluster-based approach you have been pushing to eliminate
static overhead and make it all dynamic based on actual usage.

At a high-level, if we have a single tier/swapfile, I think the only
additional overhead would be the reverse mapping from the swap slot to
the virtual swap layer, which would be 8 bytes or so for every swapped
out entry, right?

I think this was discussed before but I still wonder if we really need
a reverse mapping, if it's only to optimize swapoff then I don't think
it's a requirement. We can still scan the virtual swap layer to look
for slots to swapin. It would still be better than scanning the page
tables as we do today. But I think there were other use cases for the
reverse mapping, I just forgot what they were.
