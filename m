Other people=20
say that their hardware XXX.  (This is probably likely for anything that=20
supports ACPI.)

Could you provide an example?

In such a case, how can the kernel guarantee that the system will process=
=20
the event within (HZ / 2) seconds?

(It occurs to me that "frozen" is the wrong terminology to use.
 Perhaps "paused" would be a better term, along the lines of [1].)

The full set of processes does not need to be paused.  For example, if=20
"untrusted" processes are run in a cgroup, and only tasks in that cgroup=20
are put into TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE, then "trusted" processes will not be=20
paused.

The proposal[2] does require a kernel change.  No wakeup funnel process=20
would be needed.  The proposal is to put processes into=20
TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE, not TASK_STOPPED (unlike most "freezers").
