Will the driver use autosuspend for the 30-second delay?  Then all you
have to do is this: When the button is pressed, write 0 to
power/autosuspend_delay_ms, causing an immediate runtime suspend.  
Then before turning the display back on, write 30000 to set the delay
to 30 seconds again.  You can leave power/control set to "auto" the
whole time.

I don't like the idea of having an "off" setting in power/control.  
What happens if the user turns a disk drive controller "off" and the 
system needs to read or write something on that disk drive?
