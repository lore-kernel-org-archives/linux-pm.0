CC Catalin & Will,

It's a shame for me. :(

lockdep_rcu_suspicious() explained, rcu_read_lock can not be used after
rcu_idle_enter():

* If a CPU is in the RCU-free window in idle (ie: in the section
* between rcu_idle_enter() and rcu_idle_exit(), then RCU
* considers that CPU to be in an "extended quiescent state",
* which means that RCU will be completely ignoring that CPU.
* Therefore, rcu_read_lock() and friends have absolutely no
* effect on a CPU running in that state. In other words, even if
* such an RCU-idle CPU has called rcu_read_lock(), RCU might well
* delete data structures out from under it.  RCU really has no
* choice here: we need to keep an RCU-free window in idle where
* the CPU may possibly enter into low power mode. This way we can
* notice an extended quiescent state to other CPUs that started a grace
* period. Otherwise we would delay any grace period as long as we run
* in the idle task.

Although the cpu is still alive and not going to idle yet, the RCU is
starting to count this cpu into quiescent state. I guess it's not so
good to put off rcu_idle_enter for all archs. We need another solution
on this problem, maybe unsleepable raw_rwlock? or may best way is split
the notification and the real idle trigger in the function
arm_enter_idle_state()?
