Apparently, there are children registered under the bridge device
before the driver for it is probed.

That is kind of unusual and I'm not really sure why it happens at all,
because (in theory) the bridge driver should be responsible for
assigning resources to the devices on the bus, among other things.
Depending on what the reason is, your suggestion may or may not work.
