Gar...  I think I was just totally wrong on this.  I think your
original code was fine.  Sorry Eduardo and Greg.

This is a threaded IRQ so the regular spin_lock is fine or even the
mutex would have been.

IRQ_ONESHOT is about triggering a second IRQ before the first one
has been finished, btw.

I am an idiot.
