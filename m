Right, sorry about that. The changelog should say that the PCI core
skips PCI bridges and PCIe ports.

The relevant code is in drivers/pci/pci-driver.c:pci_pm_suspend_noirq():

        if (!pci_dev->state_saved) {
                pci_save_state(pci_dev);
                if (!pci_has_subordinate(pci_dev))
                        pci_prepare_to_sleep(pci_dev);
        }

It checks if the device has subordinate devices if not moves the device
to low power state.
