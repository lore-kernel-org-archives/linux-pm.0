I guess subsystems don't care about that currently, although I haven't
checked. But the task counter will need this per thread cancellation in
migration failure, without the need for any synchronization between
can_attach, attach and exit.

Now if we want to solve this with a synchronization there, either
we task_lock() every tasks in the group in the beginning of cgroup_attach_proc().
But that's not very nice. Or we use cgroup_mutex on cgroup_exit() exit,
but that's even worse.

I guess we need the leader->sighand->siglock on both cgroup_attach_proc()
and cgroup_exit(). Besides we may have more reasons to have that:
