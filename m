Hi all,

Here's v4 repost of the two bq24190 patches against current power-supply
tree.

Regards,

Tony

Changes from v3:
- More runtime PM error handling fixes

Changes from v2:
- Several improvments for error handling and cosmetic issues based
  on comments by Liam Breck

Changes from v1:

- Call pm_runtime_dont_use_autosuspend() and pm_runtime_put_sync()
  unconditionally in bq24190_remove() as suggested by Liam

Changes from earlier set:

- Separated from Liam's changes that are now in the power-supply tree

- Moved bdi->initialized before devm_request_threaded_irq() as suggested
  by Liam

- Added missing return value check for pm_runtime_get() as suggested by
  Liam

- Updated against current power-supply tree, mostly for the probe error
  handling


Tony Lindgren (2):
  power: bq24190_charger: Check the interrupt status on resume
  power: bq24190_charger: Use PM runtime autosuspend
