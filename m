My reason for doing this was to report the hardware identification, not the
driver name. But, there would certainly be a lot less to do if I was to make
DA9061 core use the DA9062 watchdog.

I will make the changes you requested: deprecate the existing compatibility
for da9062-watchdog and make a new compatibility string which combines both
da9061 and da9062.
