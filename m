That's because they weren't broken. :-)

None of them is expected to change over the image creation, which is
why pci_pm_thaw_noirq() didn't call pci_restore_state(), but we
overlooked the fact that taking nonboot CPUs offline changed the
configuration of interrupts that needed to be restored afterward.

So this one is really exceptional.

Thanks,
