Hi Lukas,

I suppose these depend on Mika's runtime PM patches (at least, I see
Mika's commits in your github tree).  Would you mind rebasing your
patches so they apply on my pci/pm branch?  I couldn't import them
directly into stg.

I'm sure git could pull them in easily, but I use git in a very
simple-minded way.

Bjorn
