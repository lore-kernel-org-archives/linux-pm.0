In general, yes. There are some points being discussed in the other 
thread.

I wonder if this really needs to be specified. A sufficiently long 
default should be good enough for 90 something % of devices.

This I have issue with. If you are creating a platform device here, you 
are trying to work-around limitations in the linux driver model. Either 
we need some sort of pre-probe hook to the drivers to call or each 
parent node driver is responsible for checking and calling pwr-seq 
functions for child nodes. e.g. The host controller calls pwr-seq for 
the hub, the hub driver calls the power seq for the asix chip. Soon as 
we have a case too complex for the generic pwr-seq, we're going to need 
the pre-probe hook as I don't want to see a continual expansion of 
generic pwr-seq binding for ever more complex cases.

You cannot rely on order other than for logical readability. There are 
no guarantees of either the dtb or kernel ordering of properties.
