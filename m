After thinking about this problem and looking at possible ways to fix
it, I am planning to change the PRCM chain handler to be a driver, which
gets suspended along with the rest of the system. This means the PRCM
interrupt would get disabled also during this time, and it would be
enabled in the driver->complete() call, which should happen after rest
of the drivers have been able to enable their PM runtime in the
driver->resume() call chain. Do you see any problems with this approach?
The only issue I am seeing myself is if some driver decides to do
resume() in the complete() pm-op and potentially screwing the ordering
here...
