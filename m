I have tested these patches for some time now on top of v4.6 (just
dropped the ACPI hotplug patch and re-tested just to be sure) and it
works for nouveau, but only if that one is patched to avoid calling the
device-specific Optimus method. Without that patch (WIP below, I plan to
rebase it on a refactoring patch), the nvidia card stays disabled even
after the bridge returns into D0:

    nouveau 0000:01:00.0: power state changed by ACPI to D0
    nouveau 0000:01:00.0: Refused to change power state, currently in D3
    nouveau 0000:01:00.0: restoring config space at offset 0x3c (was 0xffffffff, writing 0x1ff)
    nouveau 0000:01:00.0: restoring config space at offset 0x38 (was 0xffffffff, writing 0x0)
    nouveau 0000:01:00.0: restoring config space at offset 0x34 (was 0xffffffff, writing 0x60)
    nouveau 0000:01:00.0: restoring config space at offset 0x30 (was 0xffffffff, writing 0xdf000000)
    ...
    INFO: rcu_sched self-detected stall on CPU

A workaround (until nouveau is fixed) is to disable runtime PM on the
bridge (or on nouveau with nouveau.runpm=0):

    # echo on > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:00:01.0/power/control

This was tested on a Clevo P651RA laptop (with acpi_osi="!Windows 2013",
there is a weird PCIe PM issue for which I will fill a report later).

Kind regards,
