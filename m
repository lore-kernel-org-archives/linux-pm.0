Thanks, my mailer is playing tricks on me. :-)

I must admit I don't know the details here, but that sounds quite plausible.

That's correct, but on the other hand some user space processes want to be
notified that they're going to be frozen (like NetworkManager, although it
probably wants that because of the suspend that's going to happen next).

My point here is that being observable need not be a bad thing, depending on
the viewpoint.

In fact, there are several things that wakelocks are being used for, including
the one you have mentioned, but also:

* Idleness detection (meaning "whole system idleness).
* Detection of races between system suspend and wakeup events.
* Collecting wakeup events statistics (useful for detection of misbehaving
  applications).

The system idleness detection mechanism probably makes the most of the
difference between Android and other Linux-based systems PM-wise.

There is a point in that, because timers wake up the CPU from low-power
states entered through CPUuidle.

Anyway, I don't quite get your point overall in the ongoing discussion.
I'd like to understand it, so we know we're talking about the same things. :-)

You seem to be making a point for not supporting system suspend.  That may
mean two different things, though.

First, you may be trying to say that system suspend is a bad idea in general
and it shouldn't be supported at all.  That I strongly disagree with, because
there are platforms where it is the only effective way of saving energy
on systems that are not in use, but should become available quickly if
necessary.  Moreover, there are systems where system suspend makes it possible
to save more energy than CPUidle and runtime PM combined.

Second, your point may be that for some platforms system suspend is not worth
supporting.  I don't agree with that too, although not so strongly.  To be
precise, in my opinion that is a matter of balance between the number of
features the given platform wants to support and the time and effort needed to
implement that support.

Of course, I think that system suspend is one of the features which, if
supported, make a platform more attractive from the point of view of potential
users (where I don't really mean end users, but people wanting to build a
product on top of it), but you can say that I'm biased, because I've been
working on system suspend for a long time and you may be right. :-)
That said I think that the support for system suspend is not too difficult to
implement and the benefits are readily visible.  Your opinion may be different,
but I don't see anything wrong with that as long as it is based on technical
arguments.

To conclude, the kernel will support system suspend in its current form as
long as that depends on me to any extent.  On the other hand, I'm not going to
force anyone to support it.  After all, there are platforms that don't support
system suspend right now and live with that just fine. :-)

Thanks,
Rafael
