Hi,

Here are the two bq24190 patches rebased against current power-supply
tree now that Liam's changes are applied.

I've kept Mark's acks as the changes were minor and mostly limited to
bq24190_probe() basedon Liam's changes.

Regards,

Tony


Changes from earlier set:

- Separated from Liam's changes that are now in the power-supply tree

- Moved bdi->initialized before devm_request_threaded_irq() as suggested
  by Liam

- Added missing return value check for pm_runtime_get() as suggested by
  Liam

- Updated against current power-supply tree, mostly for the probe error
  handling

Tony Lindgren (2):
  power: bq24190_charger: Check the interrupt status on resume
  power: bq24190_charger: Use PM runtime autosuspend
