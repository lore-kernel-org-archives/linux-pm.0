Agree on that. The idea is to have the kernel interfaces cleaned up
and so have better user space apps in the end.

So what is the best way to have the power tracing events elegantly cleaned up?
The proposed patch 4/4 [1] introduces a new Kconfig option
CONFIG_DEPRECATED_POWER_EVENT_TRACING which allows to select to map
the trace points to the old _OR_ to the new events API, only for the
already existing events. This gives some time for the adaptation of
the user space apps.

I understand this could require a kernel re-compilation in order to
use the old events API but I really want to avoid to duplicate the
trace points in the code to instrument, e.g.:

diff --git a/drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq.c b/drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq.c
index 199dcb9..013c274 100644
--- a/drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq.c
+++ b/drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq.c
@@ -354,5 +354,7 @@ void cpufreq_notify_transition(struct
cpufreq_freqs *freqs, unsigned int state)
 		adjust_jiffies(CPUFREQ_POSTCHANGE, freqs);
 		dprintk("FREQ: %lu - CPU: %lu", (unsigned long)freqs->new,
 			(unsigned long)freqs->cpu);
		trace_power_frequency(POWER_PSTATE, freqs->new, freqs->cpu);
+		trace_power_switch_state(POWER_PSTATE, freqs->new, freqs->cpu,
+					 smp_processor_id());

The proposed patch only changes the power tracing events API
definition files, not the code to instrument.

I am OK to re-spin the patches, only if a compromise is agreed on.
As said before the kernel Documentation and pytimechart user space
tools patches will be provided as well.
