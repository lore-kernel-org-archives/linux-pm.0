I think you should be able to test this case in your test driver by
calling pm_runtime_resume() for your test driver after your
test drive has autosuspended. Probably you need some delayed_work to
do this in your test driver unless you have some test bus to go with it.

Naturally we should fix up things yeah :) Having a test driver
that works on any architecture sure makes things easier to verify.
