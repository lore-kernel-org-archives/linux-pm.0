What other form would you suggest?

Right now, those consequences don't include also preventing the device
from going to low power during system system.  What would you do if you
had a buggy device, where you knew it couldn't handle runtime suspend?  
If you still wanted to put the whole system to sleep, you'd be stuck.

I don't see what good it would do.  Instead of adding a new flag, why 
not just let drivers point their .suspend_late methods to the new 
generic function?  That would accomplish almost the same thing without 
changing the API.

(Actually, it would be superior.  The generic suspend_late approach 
will work even if the user writes "on" to /sys/.../power/control, 
whereas your approach won't work.)
