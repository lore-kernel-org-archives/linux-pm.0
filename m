After charger manager's initially introduced, it has kept its codes without any
big change. However, the charger manager working operation isn't optimized and
it also has unused codes and non-generic interface. This series tries to make
charger manager more generic and maintainable with some fixes.

[Changes in V3]
- Add omitted patch '[1/11] Use alarmtimer for battery~' from v2 patch set.

[Changes in V2]
- Rebase patch series on latest of battery-2.6.git.
- Seperate 'power: charger-manager: Rearrange data and monitor ~' patch into
  several patches depends on its purpose.
- Add 2 patches related with polling mode.

  power: charger-manager: Use alarmtimer for battery monitoring in
    suspend.
  power: charger-manager: Use thermal subsystem interface only to get
    temperature.
  power: charger-manager: Use power_supply_changed() not private
    uevent.
