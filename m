Correct; not until your first patch indeed.

Right; but my argument was mostly that if sched_setparam() is a useful
interface, a 'pure' KEEP_POLICY would be too and your (1) looses that.

So I must admit to not seeing much use for sched_setparam() (and its
equivalents) myself, but given it is an existing interface, I also think
it would be nice to cover that functionality in the sched_setattr()
call.

That is; I know of userspace priority-ceiling implementations using
sched_setparam(), but I don't see any reason why that wouldn't also work
with sched_setscheduler() (IOW always also set the policy).

These syscalls aren't what I consider fast paths anyway. However, there
are people that rely on the scheduler syscalls not to schedule
themselves, or rather be non-blocking (see for example that prio-ceiling
implementation).

And in that respect the newly introduced uclamp_mutex does appear to be
a problem.

Also; do you expect these clamp values to be changed often?

Nothing worse than any other random reschedule would cause.

I haven't gotten that far; but I would prefer not to have two different
'change' paths in __sched_setscheduler().
