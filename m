Because allowing that to happen was a mistake in the first place.

Which is wrong.  At least, as I said in a different thread, no runtime PM
stuff should be run after .suspend() has returned for the given device.
Otherwise it will violate some assumptions regarding the conditions in which
the _noirq() callbacks are run.

Oh well, I wonder how much of a difference would make you think those things
are really different. ;-)

Very much so.

And I wouldn't.

No, it doesn't.  What you're trying to do is to "maunally" trigger runtime PM
when _you_ think is suitable.

Please.  Why do you want to use subsys->runtime_suspend() _directly_ instead of
implementing .suspend_noirq() in the subsystem and allowing the core to run it
for you?  Quite frankly, I don't get it.

No.  Please see above.

It won't be called during system suspend at all.  It doesn't have to be
called and it really shouldn't be called at that time.

Let me put it this way.  We have runtime PM callbacks and we have system suspend
callbacks _precisely_ because we want people to use the former for runtime PM
and the latter for system suspend.  We introduced different callback pointers
for the two things _on_ _purpose_ and I totally disagree with your trying to
play games to avoid using some of them.

I hope that's clear enough.

Thanks,
Rafael
