Sounds like your device is hitting deper idle states during idle. If
you want to disable that, set the UART autosuspend_delay_ms to -1:

#/bin/bash
uarts=$(find /sys/class/tty/tty[SO]*/device/power/ -type d)
for uart in $uarts; do
        echo -1 > $uart/autosuspend_delay_ms 2>&1
done

The above will keep the UARTs active blocking any deeper idle
states. I believe the value has to be -1 instead of 0 to disable
autoidle.. but please verify yourself.

Maybe test if the above script helps with the Ethernet too. If the
Ethernet controller is on GPMC, it's not blocking deeper idle states
automatically in hardware. Adding DMA support to the Ethernet driver
would be a good way to block deeper idle states automatically by
the Ethernet hardware.
