I'm not aware of any particular reason why making ->complete run
top-down wouldn't work.  Of course, if you did then the environment at
the start of the ->complete callback wouldn't be the same as it was at
the end of the ->prepare callback.

I think originally the idea was just to mirror ->prepare.  Perhaps
Rafael will remember something that has escaped me.

I don't know about PCI (although what you describe sounds like a bug).  

USB relies on a freezable workqueue for adding child devices, so it
stops adding children even before the prepare phase begins.
