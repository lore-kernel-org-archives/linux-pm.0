Handling this with parent/child relationships is the way to go for
runtime PM.  

In MFD, are all sub-devices always children of the core device in the
LDM?  If so, it seems relatively easy to handle.  If the parent/child
relationships are modeled correctly in the LDM, then the children do not
have to know anything about their parent, the runtime PM core will handle
this (parent will not be runtime suspended until all the children are.)
