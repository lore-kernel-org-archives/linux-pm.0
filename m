This addresses the runtime pm of the SDIO card device, not the function
devices.  SDIO cards do not have drivers, only the functions do.

This is before the SDIO function devices have been added and consequently
before the SDIO function drivers have been probed.

Since none of the functions have drivers, mmc_pm_notify() doesn't remove the
card anyway.
