It sounds like you are suggesting there should be a general mechanism
for userspace to tell the kernel (or the input core) to ignore all
events from a particular input device -- or even from all input devices
-- thereby allowing those devices to go to low power.

I don't like to think of this as "forcing runtime suspend".  It's more
like telling the kernel that a device is no longer being used, so the
natural runtime PM mechanism can put it in runtime suspend.

Perhaps another way to think about it is that these input devices 
should not increment their runtime usage counter as part of the open 
routine; they should use something other than the number of open file 
references to indicate when they can go into runtime suspend.  (I'm not 
sure what else they should use, though.)
