Include "PCIe WAKE#" signal in the subject, since this is specifically
about that wire.

I think you're referring to what the spec calls "the WAKE# signal".
It will reduce confusion if you use exactly the same notation as the
spec.

No thoughts yet.  Seems like this needs a little more time in the
oven, and I'll take a deeper look after some of the issues you pointed
out have been addressed.
