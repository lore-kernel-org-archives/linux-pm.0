here is my original comment ("on" was replaced by continuous "now"):

    twl4030_charger: add software controlled linear charging mode.
   =20
       adds a sysfs control node to achieve that.
       It can be set to
       auto: normal automatic charging is enabled (default)
       off: charging is off
       on: charing is on (software controlled)
           CC/CV mode is still automatically done,
           but end of charge due to low current not.
   =20
    Note: If linear charging mode is used there should be some method of
    stopping charging automatically. It is not a so time-critical, but
    it is the wrong setting for leaving a charger connected for several
days since Lithium batteries should not be kept at 100% for longer
periods. Linear charging does a good job with not so reliable power
sources, since several voltage controlling is then often too
intelligent. It was used with a bike hub dynamo since a year or so. In
that case there are automatically charging stops when the cyclist needs
a break. Signed-off-by: Andreas Kemnade <andreas@kemnade.info>

Hmm, I guess the twl4030_charger would not be the only one destroying
such chargers. I have seen such hub dynamo-friendly behaviour on every
device I had connected to it before (an ipaq h2200, openmoko gta02).
I have checked all usb wall plug chargers I have seen and I found none
which has a lower current then 500mA. Only one has 500mA. The rest has
1A or even 2A.

But I think the non-ending cv stuff is a reason enough so that it is not
the default charge method. I use it only at bootup when battery is low
to have some time to fix charging issues manually and when cycling.
Cycling is detected by acceleration values and I get some feedback if
that charge mode is enabled or disabled.

Regards.
