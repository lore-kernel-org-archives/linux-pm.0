As Alan said, I'm not sure why that is a problem, because device power
domain can (and most likely should) provide system suspend callbacks as well
as runtime PM callbacks.  Those callbacks can be designed to do whatever is
needed.

Well, it looks like my previous message wasn't clear enough. :-)

Whether or not user space has disabled runtime PM _doesn't_ _matter_ for
system suspend, because _you_ _can't_ call pm_runtime_suspend(), or
pm_runtime_put_sunc(), from a driver's .suspend() callback _anyway_.
The reason is that doing that would cause the subsystem's (or power
domain's in this case) .runtime_suspend() callback to be invoked and
that's incorrect.  Namely, it would require the subsystem (power domain)
to expect that its .runtime_suspend() would always be executed indirectly
as a result of calling its .suspend() (through the driver's callback)
and that expectation may or may not be met (depending on the driver's
design).

The appropriate way to handle system suspend is to provide subsystem
(or power domain) .suspend()/.resume() callbacks that will do whatever is
needed at the subsystem level and will call the corresponding driver
callbacks.  There is no need whatsoever to involve runtime PM into this
in any way.

Well, again.  There's nothing to avoid, because all the thing you'd like to do
is incorrect in the first place.

Yes, see above.

Well, let me repeat: you need to separate the system suspend handling from
runtime PM.  Each of them requires a different approach, because the goal
is really different in both cases (basically, runtime PM triggers when
the device is _known_ to be idle, while system suspend may trigger while
it's actually being used).

There is a good opportunity to discuss those things during the Linux
Plumbers Conference in September.  We are going to have a Linux PM
miniconference during that event which you are welcome to attend. :-)

Yes, it did and the internet is already working, thanks!

Take care,
