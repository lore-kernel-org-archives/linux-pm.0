So exactly like I was saying it is all about the PM and thus input layer
is really the wrong place to solve this.

What do you mean? It may not follow system-whide PM transtitions but it
is per-device PM transition that I believe everyone wants to have
support for. You shut off devices individually and in subtrees when they
are not in use/needed.

I think last time Rafael mentioned that runtime PM did not allow for
forcing power state from userspace but I wonder if it would be possible
for userspace to signal and "accelerate" the idle state for a device and
then standard runtime PM framework would kick in...
