This patch set adds initial support for the Dialog DA9150 Integrated Charger &
Fuel-Gauge IC. The device also provides GPIO and GPADC functionality.

In this patch set the following is provided:
 - MFD Core support and DT bindings documentation.
 - IIO GPADC support and DT bindings documentation.
 - Power Supply Charger support and DT bindings documentation.
 - Update to MAINTAINERS file to add DA9150 files to Dialog support list.

To keep patch submission from being too large, support for GPIO and Fuel-Gauge
will come after initial support patches are accepted.

This patch set is baselined against the v3.19-rc5 kernel version.

Changes in v6:
- For GPADC driver, Use lower case extended names for IIO GPADC channels, and
  remove extended names for GPIO related channels.
- For charger driver, revert to no devm IRQ request/free functions as ordering
  is important, and probe failure scenario was not being correctly covered. A
  helper function for free IRQs has been added to make code cleaner.

Changes in v5:
- Use sizeof(*gpadc) instead of sizeof(struct da9150_gpadc) in GPADC driver.
- Fix erroneous goto for IRQ failure in GPADC driver. Now returns err directly.
- Remove IIO ABI document patch as this has been taken by maintainer.

Changes in v4:
- Correct MODULE_AUTHOR lines so e-mail addresses correctly surrounded with <>.
- Update to MFD binding document to remove unnecesary I2C reference, make
  module description generic, and add link to interrupt binding documentation.
- For GPADC driver, irq request moved above iio related calls in probe() to
  mirror correctly the remove() function ordering, as requested.
- For charger driver, remove additional sysfs entries as these are not necessary
  (debug only).
- For charger driver, add helper function for requesting IRQs, to make probe()
  function cleaner/simpler.

Changes in v3:
- IRQ register and remove helper functions removed from MFD, deemed unnecessary.
  Drivers using helper functions updated to use direct calls to relevant
  kernel framework functions.
- MFD I2C file removed and code folded into -core file as requested.
- MFD core now buildable as driver module.
- Platform data structure definition moved into core header, pdata.h removed.
- Update functions in GPADC driver to be static, where appropriate.
- Change units of GPADC readings to match ABI documentation. Updates to charger
  driver also made to align with this modification.
- Refactor GPADC temp calculations to use scale & offset method.
- Scale values now returned as FRACTIONAL to allow for accurate conversion in
  user-space.
- Tidy up of GPADC scale, offset and raw functions to return from case statements
  with correct return types.
- Update GPADC channel macros naming to prefix with DA9150, prevent conflict.
- GPADC GPIO voltage readings actually in 6V range, updated accordingly.
- Addition to IIO ABI document to add details on input current readings.
- Small style updates to address comments.

Changes in v2:
 - Drop devicetree prefix patch as this is being dealt with separately.
 - IIO framework fix patch removed from set, has already been accepted/merged.
 - Use __ instead of _ for protecting #ifdefs in headers.
 - Moved private data & definitions to source files and remove unwanted headers.
 - Bug fix to EXPORT_SYMBOL for common functions in MFD core used by
   sub-devices, so they can be correctly built as kernel modules.
 - Removed unnecessary channels from GPADC IIO driver to simplify code.
 - For GPADC IIO driver, VBAT reading now provides scale and offset values as it
   is a linear scale.
 - GPADC read code refactored to make it tidier.
 - Remove use of flag to indicate GPADC availability. IIO framework should
   indicate need to defer if it's not yet instantiated.
 - Unwanted comments removed.
 - Removed conditional shutdown of device (Charger/MFD) as this is not needed.
 - Removed AC type supply from charger as device cannot differentiate. Now just
   uses USB supply type.
 - Removed use of invalid-tbat flag from platform data as it doesn't really add
   anything to the driver except forcing battery present status.
 - Bug fix for checking of usb_phy validity in Charger probe() function.
 - Addition of common IRQ release function to allow sub-devices to explicitly
   tidy up IRQs when devm clean up is too late.
 - Improved tidy up of resources in charger.
 - Fix location of IIO GPADC related devicetree binding document so it now
   resides correctly under 'adc' directory.
 - Add update to MAINTAINERS file to include these files in Dialog support list.
