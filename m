Most devices have one regmap per device which can be retrieved with
dev_get_regmap(), it's the attempt to use that which I suspect is
broken.  Like I said snd_soc_codec_init_regmap() ought to fix things if
that's the issue.

Most of the non-TWL ones have no active users I'm aware of but fsl_ssi.c
is under active development at the minute, one series was getting some
successful testing earlier today so if it's broken I'd hope someone
would have noticed although since it doesn't use DAPM or anything
snd_soc_read()/write() will never get used.  cx20442 was only in a
single archaic consumer product, uda1380 has been legacy since before I
was ever involved in ASoC.
