If you mean ACPI S0, it is not a standby state.  It actually is the full-power
state.

Another naming confusion.  How smart.

That's correct, unless you go directly from one low-power state to another
(which is possible for example for PCI).  We don't do that at the moment,
but it's possible in principle and we may want to start doing that at one
point.
