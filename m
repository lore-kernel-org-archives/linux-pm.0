Document and implement Apple's ACPI-based (but nonstandard) mechanism to
power the controller up and down as needed.  Briefly, an ACPI method
provided by Apple is used to cut power to the controller.  A GPE is
enabled while the controller is powered down which side-band signals a
plug event, whereupon we reinstate power using the ACPI method.

This saves 1.7 W on machines with a Light Ridge controller and is
reported to save 4 W on Cactus Ridge 4C and Falcon Ridge 4C.  It fixes
(at least partially) a power regression introduced in Linux 3.17 by
commit 7bc5a2bad0b8 ("ACPI: Support _OSI("Darwin") correctly").

A Thunderbolt controller appears to the OS as a set of PCI devices:  One
NHI (Native Host Interface) and multiple bridges.  Power is cut to the
entire set of devices.  The Linux pm model is hierarchical and assumes
that a child cannot resume before its parent.  To conform to this model,
power control must be governed by the Thunderbolt controller's topmost
device, which is the upstream bridge.  This is achieved by binding to it
as a Thunderbolt port service driver:

  (Root Port) ---- Upstream Bridge --+-- Downstream Bridge 0 ---- NHI
                                     +-- Downstream Bridge 1 --
                                     +-- Downstream Bridge 2 --
                                     ...

There are no Thunderbolt specs publicly available from Intel or Apple,
so I've included documentation to the extent that I was able to reverse-
engineer things.  Documentation on the Go2Sx and Ok2Go2Sx pins is
tentative as those are missing on my Light Ridge.  Apple only uses them
on Cactus Ridge 4C.  Someone with such a controller needs to find out
through experimentation if the documentation is accurate and amend it if
necessary.

To maximize power saving, the controller is left asleep during the
system suspend process ("direct-complete" in runtime pm lingo).  We also
opt out of the mandatory runtime resume after system suspend which was
introduced with 58a1fbbb2ee8 ("PM / PCI / ACPI: Kick devices that might
have been reset by firmware").  We're better than OS X there, which
always wakes the controller after system sleep for no apparent reason.
Finally, we also do not wake the controller on system shutdown to avoid
stalling the shutdown procedure by 2 seconds (that's how long it takes
for the controller to power up).

+/*
+ * Apple provides the following means for power control in ACPI:
+ *
+ * * On Macs with Thunderbolt 1 Gen 1 controllers (Light Ridge, Eagle Ridge):
+ *   * XRPE method ("Power Enable"), takes argument 1 or 0, toggles a GPIO pin
+ *     to switch the controller on or off.
+ *   * XRIN named object (alternatively _GPE), contains number of a GPE which
+ *     fires as long as something is plugged in (regardless of power state).
+ *   * XRIL method ("Interrupt Low"), returns 0 as long as something is
+ *     plugged in, 1 otherwise.
+ *   * XRIP and XRIO methods, unused by OS X driver.
+ *
+ * * On Macs with Thunderbolt 1 Gen 2 controllers (Cactus Ridge 4C):
+ *   * XRIN not only fires as long as something is plugged in, but also as long
+ *     as the controller's CIO switch is powered up.
+ *   * XRIL method changed its meaning, it returns 0 as long as the CIO switch
+ *     is powered up, 1 otherwise.
+ *   * Additional SXFP method ("Force Power"), accepts only argument 0,
+ *     switches the controller off. This carries out just the raw power change,
+ *     unlike XRPE which disables the link on the PCIe Root Port in an orderly
+ *     fashion before switching off the controller.
+ *   * Additional SXLV, SXIO, SXIL methods to utilize the Go2Sx and Ok2Go2Sx
+ *     pins (see background below). Apparently SXLV toggles the value given to
+ *     the POC via Go2Sx (0 or 1), SXIO changes the direction (0 or 1) and SXIL
+ *     returns the value received from the POC via Ok2Go2Sx.
+ *   * On some Macs, additional XRST method, takes argument 1 or 0, asserts or
+ *     deasserts a GPIO pin to reset the controller.
+ *   * On Macs introduced 2013, XRPE was renamed TRPE.
+ *
+ * * On Macs with Thunderbolt 2 controllers (Falcon Ridge 4C and 2C):
+ *   * SXLV, SXIO, SXIL methods to utilize Go2Sx and Ok2Go2Sx are gone.
+ *   * On the MacPro6,1 which has multiple Thunderbolt controllers, each NHI
+ *     device has a separate XRIN GPE and separate TRPE, SXFP and XRIL methods.
+ *
+ * Background:
+ *
+ * * Gen 1 controllers (Light Ridge, Eagle Ridge) had no power management
+ *   and no ability to distinguish whether a DP or Thunderbolt device is
+ *   plugged in. Apple put an ARM Cortex MCU (NXP LPC1112A) on the logic board
+ *   which snoops on the connector lines and, depending on the type of device,
+ *   sends an HPD signal to the GPU or rings the Thunderbolt XRIN doorbell
+ *   interrupt. The switches for the 3.3V and 1.05V power rails to the
+ *   Thunderbolt controller are toggled by a GPIO pin on the southbridge.
+ *
+ * * On gen 2 controllers (Cactus Ridge 4C), Intel integrated the MCU into the
+ *   controller and called it POC. This caused a change of semantics for XRIN
+ *   and XRIL. The POC is powered by a separate 3.3V rail which is active even
+ *   in sleep state S4. It only draws a very small current. The regular 3.3V
+ *   and 1.05V power rails are no longer controlled by the southbridge but by
+ *   the POC. In other words the controller powers *itself* up and down! It is
+ *   instructed to do so with the Go2Sx pin. Another pin, Ok2Go2Sx, allows the
+ *   controller to indicate if it is ready to power itself down. Apple wires
+ *   Go2Sx and Ok2Go2Sx to the same GPIO pin on the southbridge, hence the pin
+ *   is used bidirectionally. A third pin, Force Power, is intended by Intel
+ *   for debug only but Apple abuses it for XRPE/TRPE and SXFP. Perhaps it
+ *   leads to larger power saving gains. They utilize Go2Sx and Ok2Go2Sx only
+ *   on Cactus Ridge, presumably because the controller somehow requires that.
+ *   On Falcon Ridge they forego these pins and rely solely on Force Power.
+ *
+ * Implementation Notes:
+ *
+ * * The controller is powered down once all child devices have suspended and
+ *   its autosuspend delay has elapsed. The delay is user configurable via
+ *   sysfs and should be lower or equal to that of the NHI since hotplug events
+ *   are not acted upon if the NHI has suspended but the controller has not yet
+ *   powered down. The delay should not be zero to avoid frequent power changes
+ *   (e.g. multiple times just for lspci -vv) since powering up takes 2 sec.
+ *   (Powering down is almost instantaneous.)
