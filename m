I'm not sure I follow this requirement.  Why is that so?

Well, OK.  The runtime PM status of the device after system resume should
better reflect its physical state.

[The physical state of the device may not be under the control of the
kernel in some cases, like in S3 resume on some systems that reset
devices in the firmware and so on, but let's set that aside.]

However, for the runtime PM status of the device may still reflect its state
if, say, a ->resume_early of the middle layer is called during resume along
with a driver's ->runtime_resume.  That still can produce the right state
of the device and all depends on the middle layer.

On the other hand, as I said before, using a middle-layer ->runtime_suspend
during a system sleep transition may be outright incorrect, say if device
wakeup settings need to be adjusted by the middle layer (which is the
case for some of them).

Of course, if the middle layer expects the driver to point its
system-wide PM callbacks to pm_runtime_force_*, then that's how it goes,
but the drivers working with this particular middle layer generally
won't work with other middle layers and may interact incorrectly
with parents and/or children using the other middle layers.

I guess the problem boils down to having a common set of expectations
on the driver side and on the middle layer side allowing different
combinations of these to work together.

I've just looked at the genpd code and quite frankly I'm not sure how this
works, but I'll figure this out. :-)

Well, not for the ACPI PM domain too.

In general, not if the wakeup settings are adjusted by the middle layer.

Well, agreed.

In some simple cases, though, driver callbacks can be reused for hibernation
too, so it would be good to have a common way to do that too, IMO.

This requires the parent driver or middle layer to look at the reference
counter and understand it the same way as pm_runtime_force_*.

Say you want to leave the parent suspended after system resume, but the
child drivers use pm_runtime_force_suspend|resume().  The parent would then
need to use pm_runtime_force_suspend|resume() too, no?

In which cases the middle-layer callbacks don't exist, so it's just like
reusing driver callbacks directly. :-)

Something different.

But overall, as I said, this is about common expectations.

Today, some middle layers expect drivers to point their callback pointers
to the same routine in order to resue it (PCI, ACPI bus type), some of them
expect pm_runtime_force_suspend|resume() to be used (AMBA, maybe genpd),
and some of them have no expectations at all.

There needs to be a common ground in that area for drivers to be able to
work with different middle layers.

Yes, it does, thank you!
