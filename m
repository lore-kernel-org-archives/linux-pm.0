If I add that call and remove the pme_poll check in
pcie_port_runtime_idle (pme_poll seems to be set for all devices) then
it seems to work. The bridge goes to D3 if no device is present or if
all devices below it are in D3. It even reacts to hotplug events while
in D3. I'm not sure that everything *really* works as I cannot see any
code that would call resume/suspend on the individual port service
drivers (as compared to the system suspend path). It probably just
works by accident.

Anyhow, the reason I was trying to do this is, is that I observed
different behavior from a device in runtime D3 as compared to system
suspend. I thought it might have something to do with the power status
of the parent bridge, but that turned out to be not the case... back
to square one.
