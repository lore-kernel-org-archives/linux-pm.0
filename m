BTW, I'm not sure if the device_may_wakeup() check is really insufficient
in this particular case.

Say the device was not in runtime suspend before, but device_may_wakeup()
returns "true" for it and the system is resuming from suspend.  The device's
state should be suitable to wake up the system in any case, so the "in-band"
vs "out-of-band" difference has had to be taken care of already during system
suspend.
