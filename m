Yes, that is the case. Perhaps it is not to be called overcharge but
it is said that lithium battery charging has to stop if in CV mode the
current drops too low.  In automatic mode the charger does exactly
that.
I would not let a battery for days at 4.2V CV.mode although a lot
of cheap chargers=20

The main reason for the patch was to prevent switching off charging
when Vbus drops low. The reason was not to get out extremely much
current out of the charger.
The electrical characteristics of a  bicycle as a power source are.
- the amount of current available changes
   - 500mA at around 17km/h
- you cannot destroy it by electrically overloading

If the current is set to e.g. 500mA and that linear charging mode is
enabled, the battery gets the maximum current available (upto
500mA) regardless of the speed which is often changing.
