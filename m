=46YI, I just updated the branches on that repo. The branch
thermal_work/omap/pu has all required changes in order to get BG
driver working on 4430/4460/4470 and O5.

It relies on Rui's patch set sent to linux-pm, which reorgs the
thermal fw a bit,  combined with the generic cpu cooling device by
Amit. I also pushed in the 'pu' branch the APIs changes mentioned by
Durga on other thread.

While checking the pu branch you should be able to get a thermal zone
with cpu cooling for OMAP on the mentioned omap versions.

Once there is an agreement about the APIs between SCM core driver and
its children, I can send out the BG driver patches and this initial
omap thermal support using the generic thermal layer.

There are some changes in the core thermal layer in the
thermal_work/eduardo_thermal_upgrade. But there could be probably some
extra changes in the core layer to finalize the omap thermal support.
That's a work in progress :-)
