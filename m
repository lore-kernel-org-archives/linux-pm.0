As Tony pointed out, it prevents some devices from going to sleep right 
away.

Sure, but that update is a simple assignment statement.  It's about as 
cheap as you can get, short of doing nothing at all.

I don't follow your reasoning.  If you don't update the last_busy mark 
then the probe fails, the device goes to sleep immediately, and then 
wakes up again a fraction of a second later for another probe attempt 
(if the error was -EDEFER).  Thus you get an unnecessary suspend 
followed by an unnecessary resume.

If the error was something other than -EDEFER and there will be no more 
probes, then yes -- the device remains at full power for longer than 
necessary.  But how often does that happen?  In general, people have 
drivers that _do_ work with their devices.

Or turn autosuspend off completely when you know you're not going to
want it any more.  True.
