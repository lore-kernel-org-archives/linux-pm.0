Your crappy app does not use suspend blockers either.

No, we do not. We need correctly implemented drivers and a safe
switchover from normal event delivery to wakeup based.

And why not ? Just because suspend is not implemented as an ACPI
C-state ? 

Nonsense, if we want to push the system into suspend from the idle
state we can do that. It's just not implemented and we've never tried
to do it as it requires a non trivial amount of work, but I have done
it on an ARM two years ago as a prove of concept and it works like a
charm.

Crap. Stop beating on those lost wakeup events. If we lose them then
the drivers are broken and do not handle the switch over correctly. Or
the suspend mechanism is broken as it does not evaluate the system
state correctly. Blockers are just papering over that w/o tackling the
real problem.

Stop handwaving. Which platforms prevent us to go into suspend from
idle ? Please point me to the relevant documentation which says so.

Just because we have not tried to implemented it does not mean that we
cannot implement it.
