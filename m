Hi Linus,

Please pull from

 git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rafael/linux-pm.git \
 pm+acpi-4.4-rc2

to receive power management and ACPI material for v4.4-rc2 with
top-most commit a3767e3c9da514e63e898772b72b932f9eb3b062

 Merge branches 'acpi-smbus', 'acpi-ec' and 'acpi-pci'

on top of commit 8005c49d9aea74d382f474ce11afbbc7d7130bec

 Linux 4.4-rc1

These are mostly fixes and cleanups (ACPI core, PM core, cpufreq,
ACPI EC driver, device properties) including three reverts of recent
intel_pstate driver commits due to a regression introduced by one
of them plus support for Atom Airmont cores in intel_pstate (which
really boils down to adding new frequency tables for Airmont) and
additional turbostat updates.

Specifics:

 - Revert three recent intel_pstate driver commits one of which
   introduced a regression and the remaining two depend on the
   problematic one (Rafael Wysocki).

 - Fix breakage related to the recently introduced ACPI _CCA object
   support in the PCI DMA setup code (Suravee Suthikulpanit).

 - Fix up the recently introduced ACPI CPPC support to only
   use the hardware-reduced version of the PCCT structure as
   the only architecture to support it (ARM64) will only use
   hardware-reduced ACPI anyway (Ashwin Chaugule).

 - Fix a cpufreq mediatek driver build problem (Arnd Bergmann).

 - Fix the SMBus transaction handling implementation in the ACPI
   core to avoid re-entrant calls to wait_event_timeout() which
   makes intermittent boot stalls related to the Smart Battery
   Subsystem initialization go away and revert a workaround of
   another problem with the same underlying root cause (Chris
   Bainbridge).

 - Fix the generic wakeup interrupts framework to avoid using
   invalid IRQ numbers (Dmitry Torokhov).

 - Remove a redundant check from the ACPI EC driver (Markus Elfring).

 - Modify the intel_pstate driver so it can support more Atom flavors
   than just one (Baytrail) and add support for Atom Airmont cores
   (which require new freqnency tables) to it (Philippe Longepe).

 - Clean up MSR-related symbols in turbostat (Len Brown).

Thanks!
