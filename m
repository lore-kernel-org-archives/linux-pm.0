isn't it the same as https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/9/10/248? (in general)

And wouldn't device links solve the issue?

    driver core: Functional dependencies tracking support

    Currently, there is a problem with taking functional dependencies
    between devices into account.

My understanding of device links is that they were introduced exactly to fix
such kind of issues and explicitly define dependencies between devices in code.

But, I could be missing smth... sry if this is the case.
