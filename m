Well, I am actually not removing that existing warning in the
omap_device_enable(), as it's being called from other places as well.

It's just the runtime PM path that's being changed.

Sure.

One more thing though. I just realized that you have yet another issue
to consider going for the approach fixing *only* drivers.

Let me summarize it here:

If userspace has prevented runtime PM (pm_runtime_forbid()) when a
driver becomes unbound, the driver will not be able to suspend the
device by using any of the pm_runtime_suspend() APIs, as the usage
count is isn't zero.

As pm_runtime_reinit() is invoked as part of the driver unbind
sequence, the runtime PM status goes out of sync. A following driver
rebind will then trigger the warning when the PM domain's
->runtime_resume() callback gets invoked. Again, forever preventing
the device from being runtime suspended.

How do you intend to solve this case?
I guess there are two options, pick up the patch I posted for omap
hwmod or make use of pm_runtime_force_suspend() in the driver.

Kind regards
Uffe
