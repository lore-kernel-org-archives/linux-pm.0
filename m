Right.  The question is should it be done in this somewhat roundabout
way (you've got two separate assets for setting up this one thing), or
should the USB port code be responsible for explicitly checking if
there are any applicable assets when the port is created?

The advantange of the second approach is that it doesn't involve
checking all the ancestors every time a new device is added (and it
involves only one asset).  The disadvantage is that it works only for
USB ports.

To answer the question, we need to know how other subsystems might
want to use the asset-matching approach.  My guess is that only a small
number of device types would care about assets (in the same way that
assets matter to USB ports but not to other USB device types).  And it 
might not be necessary to check against every ancestor; we might know 
beforehand where to check (just as the USB port would know to look for 
an asset attached to the host controller device).
