That means modifying all kernel code that would use suspend blockers
to abort suspend by returning an error from suspend instead. How is
this better than using suspend blockers?

That is not how the system wakes up from suspend now. The monotonic
clock stops, and timers are ignored.

Yes a driver can abort, but the user space code that initiated suspend cann=

Do you think this is simpler than using a suspend blocker?

Opportunistic suspend does not change the default behaviour either.
Your proposal requires that all the drivers that would block suspend
using a suspend blocker, now block suspend without the help of the
suspend blocker api.

Your proposal to "pause"processes by putting them in
TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE state and stop their timers does not work. It is
effectivly the same ase freezing them, since if you "paused" it while
it was busy, a wakeup event cannot unpause it.
