Not the way I remember.  Of course, it's possible that we misunderstood 
each other at the time.

Exactly.  What we discussed at LinuxCon wasn't forcing things into
runtime suspend; it was disabling remote wakeup during runtime suspend.

And even though the topic was quite different from Irina's proposal, we 
ended up settling on the same API (according to my recollection).
