My understanding is that IOBoost is there to help tasks doing many
and _frequent_ IO operations, which are relatively _not so much_
computational intensive on the CPU.

Those tasks generate a small utilization and, without IOBoost, will be
executed at a lower frequency and will add undesired latency on
triggering the next IO operation.

Isn't mainly that the reason for it?

IO operations have also to be _frequent_ since we don't got to max OPP
at the very first wakeup from IO. We double frequency and get to max
only if we have a stable stream of IO operations.

IMHO, it makes perfectly sense to use DL for these kind of operations
but I would expect that, since you care about latency we should come
up with a proper description of the required bandwidth... eventually
accounting for an additional headroom to compensate for "hidden
dependencies"... without relaying on a quite dummy policy like
IOBoost to get our DL tasks working.

At the end, DL is now quite good in driving the freq as high has it
needs... and by closing userspace feedback loops it can also
compensate for all sort of fluctuations and noise... as demonstrated
by Alessio during last OSPM:

If a task is not clamped we execute it at its required utilization or
even max frequency in case of wakeup from IO.

When a task is util_max clamped instead, we are saying that we don't
care to run it above the specified clamp value and, if possible, we
should run it below that capacity level.

If that's the case, why this clamping hints should not be enforced on
IO wakeups too?

At the end it's still a user-space decision, we basically allow
userspace to defined what's the max IO boost they like to get.
