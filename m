I don't think so.

I did notice that I left out a "would" in the final sentence

	"and either way, any such calls *would* have been causing
	crashes since 4.10"
	
which perhaps you could add when applying?

Unlike the musb patch, this one is not critical and could possibly wait
for 4.14. But since all it does is to get rid of a (since 4.10) broken
state update, and thereby those warning messages on suspend, I'd say
it's -rc material.

Thanks,
Johan
