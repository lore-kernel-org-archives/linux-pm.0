I am also not "fond" of it, but it's a sane and easy
solution and appropriate for this issue.

You mean use:
C3 NHM
instead of
NHM-C3
for intel_idle?

Then userspace has to parse the two informations glued
together, get rid of the whitespace, etc.
But by sysfs convention a separate file must be used
if two data are passed to userspace which is the case here.

See above, it would unnecessarily make life hard for
userspace.
Afaik sysfs entries do not consume resources as long as
they do not get accessed.

For acpi_idle only it would work, but this is (nearly) the only
one.
For example for sh arch:
name: SuperH
"SH SuperH" contains two data and should get split up into:
name: SuperH
abbr: SH

By convention the first characters of "description" could be
used, but you would again end up in userspace parsing and
double info in one sysfs file.

I hope that's enough for convincing, I'd really like to go
the .abbr way. Do you give me an acked-by for that one?

Thanks,
