Yes, you can go directly from PCI_D1 to PCI_D2, for one example.

Apart from this, attempting to put system suspend to the same bag as cpuidle
is not going to work in the long run.  They are _fundamentally_ different things
event though the power state we get into as a result of suspend is approximately
the same as we can get into via cpuidle (even in that case the energy savings
will generally be different in both cases due to wakeup events).
