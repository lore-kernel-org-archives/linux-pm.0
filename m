Welcome to the Arm memory model. We don't have any guarantee that an LDR
will only access memory after SEVL+WFE. They are not serialising.

True. If an interrupt is taken before the LDR (that would be a
need_resched() check for example), then a prior WFE would not matter.
This won't work if we replace the IPI with a SEV though (suggested
somewhere in this thread).

Most likely not.

If we only waited on the location passed to LDXR, things would have been
much simpler. But the osq_lock() also wants to wait on the TIF flags via
need_resched() (and vcpu_is_preempted()).

So the cond(VAL) here is actually a series of other memory loads
unrelated to 'mem'

I think this will work in principle even if 'cond' accesses other memory
locations, though I wouldn't bother with an additional 'cond' call, I'd
expect SEVL+WFE to be mostly NOPs. However, 'cond' must not set a local
event, otherwise the power saving on waiting is gone.

I think it's cleaner to use Ankur's timeout API here for the very rare
case where an IPI hits at the wrong time. We then keep
smp_cond_load_relaxed() intact as it's really not meant to wait on
multiple memory locations to change. Any changes of
smp_cond_load_relaxed() with moving the WFE around are just hacks, not
the intended use of this API.
