I picked the name for the file as pm_qos_params over pm_qos because I
wanted to make it implicitly clear that this was not an full QOS
implementation.  True QOS carries expectations similar to real time and
as the infrastructure is closer to "good intentioned" than even "best
effort" and offers no notification when the QOS request is not able to
be met and really doesn't implement a true QOS at all, (it just provides
the parameter interface for part of one its missing the notification
interface when the service level is not met and I think a few other
things.) So I wanted to have it named a bit different from just pm_qos.

This said I'm not supper attached to the naming of the modules.  If
folks want to change it I wouldn't complain (too much anyway;).

--mark
PS I'll look at the rest of the patches tomorrow, this time for real as
I'm about to have more free time to focus on non-work stuff :)
FWIW this write up sounds interesting.
