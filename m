OK, so this does sound like there's probably a genuine issue on PCs due
to limitations in the environment.  Is it possible to expose these
things to userspace in a way that's limited to the affected platforms?

That does sound like a fair characterization for PCs.  For embedded
systems where we have a *much* better knowledge of the hardware we're
running on you're just working with the basics of what the hardware
needs to run - the hardware needs whatever it needs and no matter what
you think of the quality of the hardware there's an expectation that the
kernel is ging to be able to work.

As I've said it's not the fine tuning that I'm worried about, it's the
specific mechanism that's being suggested.  Being able to tune things in
a way that's relevant to the device being tuned seems entirely sensible.

Phones are exactly the sort of case I'm primarily concerned with here.

Realistically if you're in a position where you need to work at this
very low level on an embedded device you can replace the entire firmware
on the device.  We don't want to end up in the situation where we've got
kernel support for a device and the only way to get it to actually run
sensibly is to install the silicon vendor's proprietary userspace, and
we especially don't want to end up in the situation where that userspace
is using standard and supported kernel interfaces to do its thing.

You can push that argument to extremes, of course.
