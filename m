I can certainly do that.

Could one of you guys confirm that the code above is safe on non-Macs?

Specifically, the very first Thunderbolt chips (Light Ridge, Eagle Ridge)
had no POC, i.e. they were unable to power themselves off.  Apple put an
ARM Cortex (NXP LPC1112) on the logic board which snoops on the connector
lines for hotplug detection while the Thunderbolt controller is powered
down.  The power rails to the controller are brought up and down with
separate load switches.  This functionality became integrated into the
controller starting with Cactus Ridge in 2012.

So I know the above code is safe on Macs.  However on non-Macs these
extra chips for power management may not exist, i.e. the controller
stays on all the time and then I shouldn't suspend the upstream bridge
to D3.  I assume that such machines do not exist as Apple was pretty
much the only vendor with Thunderbolt gear in the 2010-2012 time frame.
The only other one I know of was the Sony Vaio Z21 which used the
optical version of Thunderbolt to attach a docking station, but these
are rare.

If you know of non-Macs which might be broken by the above code snippet,
I could dmi-quirk this to Macs plus constrain to CONFIG_THUNDERBOLT being
enabled.

Thanks,

Lukas
