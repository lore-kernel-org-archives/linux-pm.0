 Offhand it looks like your system does not supply a PIRQ table, not at 
least at the usual locations we look through.  The presence of the table 
is reported like:

PCI: IRQ init
PCI: Interrupt Routing Table found at 0xfde10
[...]
PCI: IRQ fixup

while your system says:

PCI: IRQ init
PCI: IRQ fixup

If you have a look through /dev/mem and see if there's a "$PIR" signature 
somewhere (though not a Linux kernel area of course), then we may know for 
sure.

 I'm a little busy at the moment with other stuff and may not be able to 
look into it properly right now.  There may be no solution, not at least 
an easy one.  A DMI quirk is not possible, because:

DMI not present or invalid.

There is a PCI BIOS:

PCI: PCI BIOS revision 2.10 entry at 0xf6f41, last bus=0

however, so CONFIG_PCI_BIOS just might work.  Please try that too, by 
choosing CONFIG_PCI_GOANY or CONFIG_PCI_GOBIOS (it may break things 
horribly though I imagine).

  Maciej
