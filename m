The get_sync part doesn't matter so much.  Moving it past the notifier 
call would probably be okay -- unless one of the listeners on the 
notifier chain expects the device to be active.  Changing the get_sync 
to get_noresume would probably also be okay -- subject to a similar 
reservation.

The problem with the put_sync isn't the notifier.  If you leave it
where you've got it now, you'll end up invoking a callback at a time
when the driver thinks it no longer controls the device but the
driver-model core still thinks it does.  You certainly want to do the

	dev->driver = NULL;

first.
