Sorry for describing this poorly.
The steps are:

-> Have a kernel with CONFIG_MMC_UNSAFE_RESUME
-> Insert MMC/SD card
-> Suspend/hibernate the system
-> While system is hibernated/suspended pull the card off
-> Resume the system
-> Hang


if CONFIG_MMC_UNSAFE_RESUME is set, mmc core allows the user to
suspend/resume the card normally assuming he won't change the card or
modify it in another system. The former case is actually handled quite
well.

if CONFIG_MMC_UNSAFE_RESUME isn't set, it removes the card during
suspend, and I now think (and will test) that this will still hang the
system this time on suspend.

Maybe we can make del_disk behave well if called with userspace frozen?
After all if user calls it, very likely that hardware is absent thus
there is no point in syncing (which I think triggers the hang)....

Best regards,
