Surely, depending on your UART FIFO depth, of course, a serial console
interrupts once every 16 characters or so ... how do you filter out that
storm of interrupts refreshing the powertop screen from the actual
application problems?

But anyway, the average user probably either doesn't have or doesn't
know how to get to a serial console on their phone ...

If you actually s/app/USB storage device/ (with a few other obvious text
changes) in most of the above two paragraphs, you've got a good
description of the problems we go through on an almost daily basis in
the kernel for USB storage ... and why we've grown a massive exception
table.

Just saying "devices should conform to specifications" is a wonderful
magic wand for wishing away all the problems bad devices cause and
bludgeoning manufacturers with the said spec wrapped around a large lead
brick is very cathartic but it doesn't change the fact that users blame
the kernel for not working with the bad devices ... and we gave up
trying to re-educate users on that score years ago.
