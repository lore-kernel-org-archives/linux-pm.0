It would still be good to remove the semaphore and do something else,
as we also want to remove all semaphores. ;-)

We could check "mq->flags & MMC_QUEUE_SUSPENDED" in the kthread to see
if the queue is currently suspended, and otherwise go to sleep there,
and then call wake_up() in the resume function.

While looking at that code, I just noticed that access to 
mq->flags is racy and should be fixed as well.
