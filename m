Well, this is a bit misleading.

According to the PCI spec there are two ways to put a device into
D3cold: either by putting its bus into B3 (which for PCIe means
turning the link off IIRC) which happens when the bridge goes into
D3hot, or through the platform.

You aren't talking about any of those cases, though, so we go outside
of the spec here.

Understood.

OK

I'm not sure if dev_pm_domain is the right level.  The "can_power_off"
thing would be sort of specific to your particular use case.

Say you have something like

struct pci_pm_domain {
        struct dev_pm_domain pd;
        ...
};

so you can do something like

          } else if (dev->dev.pm_domain) {
                    struct pci_pm_domain *pci_pd =
to_pci_pm_domain(dev->dev.pm_domain);

                    ....
          } else if [...]

and it may be a bit more PCI-oriented without expanding generic data types.

Right.

> Thoughts?

Essentially, the PCI PM code needs to be told that there is a way to
put the device into D3cold by non-standard means.  There are a couple
of ways to do that (a new flag in struct pci_dev, the above, probably
more), but in any case it needs to be clear that this is non-standard
IMO.
