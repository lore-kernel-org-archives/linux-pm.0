That, among other things, is why suspend uses the freezer which guarantees
that nothing like this will happen.

Yeah, and that's why Windows owns desktop market. ;-)

Do you realistically think that by hurting the _user_ you will make the
_developer_ write better code?  No, really.

If the user likes the app very much (or depends on it or whatever makes him
use it), he will rather switch the platform to one that allows him to run that
app without _visible_ problems than complain to the developer, because _the_
_user_ _doesn't_ _realize_ that the app is broken.  From the user's
perspective, the platform that has problems with the app is broken, because
the app apparently runs without problems on concurrent platforms.

The whole "no reason to tolerate broken apps" midset is simply misguided IMO,
because it's based on unrealistic assumptions.  That's because in general users
only need the platform for running apps they like (or need or whatever).  If
they can't run apps they like on a given platform, or it is too painful to them
to run their apps on it, they will rather switch to another platform than stop
using the apps.

Thanks,
Rafael
