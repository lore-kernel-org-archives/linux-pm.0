Indeed it does. Tried with acpi_idle and intel_idle, and both appear to
resume just fine with that hack.

-       acpi_hw_execute_sleep_method(METHOD_PATHNAME__WAK, sleep_state)=
;
+       //acpi_hw_execute_sleep_method(METHOD_PATHNAME__WAK, sleep_stat=
e);
+       printk(KERN_CRIT "skipping _WAK\n");
