Small correction, that patch currently only influences Cherry Trail devices, it has:

static const struct x86_cpu_id int0002_cpu_ids[] = {
/*
  * Limit ourselves to Cherry Trail for now, until testing shows we
  * need to handle the INT0002 device on Baytrail too.
  *     ICPU(INTEL_FAM6_ATOM_SILVERMONT1),       * Valleyview, Bay Trail *
  */
        ICPU(INTEL_FAM6_ATOM_AIRMONT),          /* Braswell, Cherry Trail */
        {}
};

If anyone sees any issues where the SCI (typically irq 9) gets a nobody
cared message on Bay Trail try the linked patch with the Bay Trail line
above uncommented.

Regards,

Hans
