why?

I'm being deliberately obtuse here, but I'm afraid you guys haven't
come anywhere into the vague nearby neighbourhood of adequately describing
this feature.

Please provide proper and full reasons for merging this code into
Linux.  If they exist.  This shouldn't be too hard.

Please put yourself in my position:

me: [patch] <this stuff>
Linus: why are you sending me this?
me: I have not the faintest idea

trust me - many others will be in my position too.

So why not implement a send-signal-to-all-tasks-in-a-container
controller?
