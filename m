That sounds like a design issue, however ...

That's when the in-band device interrupt is used for wakeup, right?

I wouldn't really call all of that out of band, but really there's more to it
in general.

There may be a standard way to configure wakeup signaling which is handled by
a separate code layer, like ACPI or PCI.  In that case the driver basically
doesn't care (but it still may need to configure the device for remote
wakeup internally).  That standard way may do whatever the driver would do
to the wakeup interrupt or it may use an out-of-band mechanism.

If there is no standard way, the driver may need to set up things by itself.
In that case it needs to know what's available and how to use it, essentially
at probe time.  I guess the information then would need to come from a DT or
similar.

If it knows that it will use the sideband thing, it will not do *) obviously.

Which means exactly what?

Yeah.  Messy stuff.
