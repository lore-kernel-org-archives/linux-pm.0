(If there's a sane framework then we'll fix x86 to fit into it and will deal 
with quirks.)

I really like the level of detail and care that went into suspend-blockers, 
and i think the Android solution is very mature in terms of functionality 
offered to users.

In terms of bringing this depth of functionality and control to the upstream 
kernel, what do you think about Alan's QoS scheme, described in:

   <20100528001514.28e593ef@lxorguk.ukuu.org.uk>

?

It's in essence suspend-blockers on steroids. It consists of two main 
components:

 - Unify the 'suspended' state into the regular chain of idle states, and
   create a single, coherent and transparent way we handle system idleness.

 - Give apps a QoS attribute that allows them to express how long they can
   afford to wait for a wakeup. (A downloading app would set it to say 50msecs,
   and thus the kernel would know it automatically which method of idleness is 
   still achievable. If all currently running apps have a max(QoS) attribute 
   of infinite, then the kernel can suspend for an unlimited amount of time.)

AFAICS, and i have read through your suspend-blocker usecases, this should 
handle all the usecases you listed - and some more. (please yell if that's not 
so)

Suspend-blockers are equivalent to: 'app sets idle QoS latency to 0 msecs'.

(And on x86, for BIOS/CPU combos that allow it we can implement this scheme 
too.)

Thoughts?
