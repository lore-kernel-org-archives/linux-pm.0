I see. I've seen cases these are pre-programmed to the PMIC and then
automatically triggered based on some event like WFI.

Cool, it would be nice to have a Linux generic way for programming a
separate hardware wake-up timer. Not RTC, but some more accurate timer that
might be too slow to access for general purpose usage.
