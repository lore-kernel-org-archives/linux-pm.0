Hi Eduardo,

Thanks for your response.

As part of this patch set, I added a link to the the datasheet into the top-level MFD
component of the device tree binding: https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9426791/
You can get all the information for DA9062 and DA9061 from the patch update in that
link.

There is more information in the datasheet under the section titles "Junction
temperature supervision". The value of 125 degC comes from the "warning
temperature threshold" and the event is triggered when "the junction temperature
rises above the first threshold (TEMP_WARN), the event E_TEMP is asserted".

This suggests strictly greater than 125. However, there is no way for the chip to
know the exact temperature. The mechanism is interrupt based and triggering
only happens when the temperature rises above the threshold level.

Over-temperature triggering is event based: an interrupt happens when the
temperature rises above 125 degC. However, this event based system changes into
a polling operation to detect when the temperature falls below the threshold
level again. This asymmetry in the chip's behaviour is the reasoning behind
why I am not using the thermal core's built-in polling functionality.

When over-temperature is reached, the interrupt from the DA9061/2 will be
repeatedly triggered. The IRQ is disabled when the first over-temperature event
happens and the status bit is polled using the work-queue until it becomes false.
After that, the IRQ is re-enabled again so a new critical temperature event can
be detected.

After the interrupt has happened, event bit for the interrupt switches into a status
bit and is used for polling and detecting when the temperature drops below the
threshold.

In an earlier RFC, I examined a work-around by hijacking and toggling the
thermal core's built-in polling function when I needed to poll the temperature
through get_temp(). However I thought this was quite dangerous, since it would
not be using a formal thermal core interface.

I wanted to explicitly free_irq() before calling thermal_zone_device_unregister()
in the remove function.
