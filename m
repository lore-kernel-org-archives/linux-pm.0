I have the weird deja vu feeling... 
The DT entry I sent, I already knew it would cause troubles :-)
Having it per board it would be really a PITA. Image that every
body doing a 4430 board needs to define a BG entry...
That would work, but still do we want this?

Benoit, I guess you should know my option by now.
Ideally we should rely on revision register to decide what to do in the driver.
And as we discussed, looks like for BG this is somewhat non-existing.

If we go with the SCM revision register, what do we do if the BG goes away from SCM?

If we go with "ti,omap4-bandgap", we still need a way to say if it is 4430, 4460 or 4470.
There are configuration / settings specific for each. Not only on bandgap,
but also wrt to sensor location and hotspot extrapolation rules.

Because we lack a revision register for bandgap, one way to go is to have still the
revisioning on the same way: "ti,omapXXXX-bandgap", but having a omapXXXX.dtsi
per omap revision. But do we want to this only due to bandgap?
BTW, is it only BG which is suffering of this issue?

No please! Let's not use that stuff...

agreed with Benoit here.
