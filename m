But you can never _know_ that all the conditions are met.  Therefore =

relying on them is not safe.

Not so.  Even if a driver uses runtime PM correctly, there will still =

be times when someone else has increased the usage_count.  This happens =

during probing and during system resume, for example.

If you need a way to power down the device unconditionally then you =

must bypass the runtime-PM framework.

So tell the driver whenever the device gets powered down.  Then the
driver will never have to guess.

There is no way to prevent it.  The PM core does this already.

If the driver is careful, it can power a device down and back up
without ever telling the PM core, by calling the runtime_suspend and
runtime_resume methods directly.  You'll have to figure out whether =

this sort of approach can solve your problem.

It isn't _wrong_; that's why I said I wouldn't NAK it.

We gain stack space (by not having a potentially lengthy sequence of =

nested calls), which is relatively unimportant, and we gain latency.  =

The latency may help in some situations; if the device is resumed again =

quickly enough then we may avoid suspending the parent entirely.
