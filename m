right, ideally, yeah; but then we go back to the discussion regarding
kernel vs bootloader dependencies :-)

however this is not a hack, right ? If we get rid of OPP_NITRO and
OPP_TURBO, then we will more than likely always be dealing with safe
OPPs (yeah, I need to confirm this since it's not on public TRM, so as
of now, take this statement with a grain of salt :-), moreover, even
though we're trying to change opp bindings, the current situation is
still very much accepted and will remain valid even after changing
binding :-)

Not to mention that people using AM43xx today might be using it under
invalid OPPs and decreasing silicon life; I'd assume that's a very
urgent detail to sort out.
