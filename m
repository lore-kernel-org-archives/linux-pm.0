Yep, it sounds like the PCIe controller device is partitioned across
multiple PM domains.

Actually, it's the other way around.

You need only one device to attach the PM domains. However, in genpd,
one device will be created per PM domain and its that device you get
back to operate upon.

Typically the returned device(s) should be linked with the "master"
device, device_link_add().

I you need them to be powered on, just use the corresponding device
links flags when you create the link during probe.

Something along the lines of this:

device_link_add(dev, genpd_dev0, DL_FLAG_STATELESS |
DL_FLAG_PM_RUNTIME | DL_FLAG_RPM_ACTIVE);

Maybe not, I don't have the complete picture.

However, you do get the opportunity to use the genpd infrastructure,
which calls the ->power_on|off() callbacks of the PM domain during
suspend/resume. And by using the dev_link_add(), you can make sure
that the PM domain gets powered on/off in the order as the
corresponding supplier device.

Kind regards
