As far as I understand the twl4030 charger and MADC it is not possible =
to
separate these values. It is only reporting the inflow from charger to
battery + system. So you don=92t know how many mA are supplying the sys=
tem
and how many mA are left over for charging.

You can only assume how much the system is drawing while running (somet=
hing
between 50 and 600 mA but this depends on system activities, power stat=
e
of peripherald and e.g. backlight being switched on).

I think your basic assumption that we know any time how many mA the sys=
tem
is taking is not given.

But where do you know this value from to write it into a DT file?
Usually you can=92t measure it easily and for some batteries you don=92=
t have
a data sheet.

Contrary, the calibration curves can easily be measured on the device
(assuming that the charge level decreases/increases linearly over time
between Full and Empty).

I tend to make software easy to use for the user (developer of a board =
support
package) of a driver, not theoretically correct or mathematically elega=
nt.

Because the right solution for all these issues is to use a fuel gauge =
chip
(bq27xxx).

This driver is just for systems where the hardware designer did forget
(or did not want to spend money) for such a chip, but user space
expects some /sys/class/power_supply indication (e.g. Android/Replicant=
).

The missing optimal precision is something we can live with.

I am not convinced that it can be really done better, considering the
limitations of the twl4030 circuits, and I doubt that it is worth the e=
fforts
of doing it better.

Yes, but what is the problem? We have different device trees for each
machine anyways. And as soon as they differ in battery characteristics
the coefficients for your calculation have to be defined for each machi=
ne.

So someone has to write in some DT values (difficult to understand
and derive coefficients or two simple mapping tables).

To me it looks as if you want to make it a 100% solution while I am hap=
py
with the 80% solution, which already exists as a platform data driver a=
nd
just want to get it back into DT based boards.

So I would suggest that Mareks patches to make the platform data
driver DT compatible are applied first, and you are invited to submit a
technically better solution for testing on real hardware.

BR,
Nikolaus
