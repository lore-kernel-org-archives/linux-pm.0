If I define pr_fmt and then include <linux/printk.h> I get the error
above because <linux/printk.h> seems to include <linux/ratelimit.h>
via some sub-includes, and this defines the static inline which
expands pr_fmt and fails because dev_name() is not yet defined.

There are already 51 files in the tree using the '#undef pr_fmt' idiom,
so this is pretty common:

    # /bin/ls | egrep -v '(\.git|debian)' | xargs egrep -r '#undef pr_fmt' | wc -l
      51

However what I can do is drop the '#ifdef pr_fmt', it's unnecessary,
I think I cargo-culted this from one of these 51 files.

The "pcieport" string is hardcoded in drivers/pci/pcie/portdrv_pci.c
and I'd like to avoid cluttering this file with some quirk which is
specific to this Mac Thunderbolt driver.

thunderbolt_power_fini() is called from the ->remove hook of
thunderbolt.ko.  I could in principle call it conditionally
but I think clarity improves if I perform the check here because
the conditions that might lead to tb->power being NULL are
visible immediately before this function in thunderbolt_power_init().

Thanks,
