That is a fair point.

I do not have anything against calling pm_runtime_allow() here. In fact
we already do the same in Intel LPSS drivers. I just wanted to bring
that up.

Rafael, what do you think?

If we anyway are going to add cut-off date to enable runtime PM we
should expect that the hardware is also capable of doing so (and if not
we can always blacklist the exceptions).

BTW, I can add both calls to the next version of PCIe runtime PM patches
if you are OK with that, and all agree this is a good idea.
