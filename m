The goal is to afford direct-complete to devices which are not power-
manageable by the platform but can still be runtime suspended to D3cold.
Right now we wake those devices up from D3cold to D3hot before going to
sleep, which is a waste of energy and prolongs the suspend sequence
(waking up the Thunderbolt controller takes 2 seconds).

The de facto standard to power manage such devices seems to be with
dev_pm_domain_set(). That's what vga_switcheroo does and I'll move
to that as well for v3 of this series.

I could add a "bool can_power_off" to struct dev_pm_domain.

Then I could change pci_target_state() like this:

 	pci_power_t target_state = PCI_D3hot;
 
 	if (platform_pci_power_manageable(dev)) {
 		[...]
+	} else if (dev->dev.pm_domain && dev->dev.pm_domain.can_power_off) {
+		target_state = PCI_D3cold;
 	} else if [...]

Another idea would be to add a ->choose_state hook to dev_pm_domain,
but that would have to return a PCI-specific power state, so we'd be
in clumsy territory again.

Thoughts?
