If I introduce a struct pci_pm_domain like you suggested, it would mean
that *all* PCI devices using dev_pm_domain_set() have to be changed,
else the container_of() wouldn't work. The resulting code bloat alone
inhibits me from implementing this. Plus, it's a tripwire for anyone
wishing to assign a dev_pm_domain to their PCI device.

That seems like a small tradeoff compared to introducing a struct
pci_pm_domain.

If you dislike a can_power_off flag in struct dev_pm_domain, that only
leaves the option to add a one-liner to pci_target_state(), unless I'm
missing something.

BTW there seems to be a contradiction in your statements on wakeup devices:

However earlier you wrote:

So on the one hand, you warn that a wakeup-capable device may have been
put into D3cold at runtime but needs to be woken before system sleep
because it might otherwise not be able to signal wakeup.

On the other hand you say that such devices should not be put into D3cold
at runtime at all.

Which one is it?

Thanks,

Lukas
