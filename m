The macro was introduced with

    commit aa8c6c93747f7b55fa11e1624fec8ca33763a805
    Author: Rafael J. Wysocki <rjw@sisk.pl>

    PCI PM: Restore standard config registers of all devices early

but the only usage of it was removed with

    commit 476e7faefc43f106a90b5c96166c59b75de19d30
    Author: Rafael J. Wysocki <rjw@sisk.pl>

    PCI PM: Do not wait for buses in B2 or B3 during resume

Best regards,

Lukas
