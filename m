Yes, but that's *after* pm_runtime_reinit() was added.

I think Rafael was thinking about how it worked *before*.

I totally agree!

Okay, so I understand that you decided to not pick up the omap hwmod
patch I posted.

If you want some further help in fixing the omap drivers, please just
tell me I am at your service. :-)

Also, we must not forget to also update their runtime PM calls in
their ->remove() callbacks, as those seems to suffer from the same
problem as in the -EPROBE_DEFER case.
