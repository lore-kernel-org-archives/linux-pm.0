It does. Not being idle is tracked by cpuidle driver as state 0
(arch independent):
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpuidle/state0/
halt/C1 on X86 is:
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpuidle/state1/
...

That is not true for PCI, probably others as well.
There you have D0 (being the maximum powered state) up to D3.
Same for PCI Bus Power States (B0, B1, B2, and B3).

Look at drivers/pci/pci.c:pci_raw_set_power_state()
To "exit" a power state you call:
pci_raw_set_power_state(dev, PCI_D0);

Same for suspend. "Exit" suspend is:
#define PM_SUSPEND_ON           ((__force suspend_state_t) 0)
so on resume we enter suspend_state_t 0.

Yes, you do not need two different events to track one thing.

Yes, A user who wants to enable processor idle tracking does
want to enable it via:
echo power:processor_idle >/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/enable
what do you intend to track with a:
power:power_start
event?
