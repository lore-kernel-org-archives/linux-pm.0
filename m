Something like cgroup_freezer is probably more useful, since it can freeze 
a configurable subset of processes.  Consider the common mobile use-case 
of audio playback while the display, touchscreen, etc. are disabled.  
In such a case, large portions of userspace can be frozen or paused, but 
not all.

Are you thinking of the current userspace interfaces to suspend, or 
something else?

Perhaps the same interface would be useful for CPUIdle-based approaches.

Yes.

No, nothing specific.

Yes, that's a better way of putting it; hopefully most drivers are doing 
that.
