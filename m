There's this check in acpi_device_get_power():

                else if (result == ACPI_STATE_UNKNOWN)
                        result = psc > ACPI_STATE_D2 ? ACPI_STATE_D3_HOT : psc;

where "result" has been set further up by acpi_power_get_inferred_state().
If acpi_power_get_inferred_state() does return this value and _PSC is
not present (i.e. device->power.flags.explicit_get is not set),
then acpi_device_get_power() would return ACPI_STATE_UNKNOWN.

Also, if the device is not power manageable, has neither power resources
nor _PSC, and its parent has power state ACPI_STATE_UNKNOWN, then this
will be returned.

Fair enough, I'm only checking for ACPI_STATE_UNKNOWN now.

I've moved the change of pci_update_current_state() to a separate patch now,
that will also make it easier to revert it, should anything blow up.

pci_update_current_state() is called whenever a device is resumed
(both runtime and after system sleep) and after changing its power
state using the platform in pci_platform_power_transition().

With the new patch, pci_update_current_state() will be more accurate
than it is now:  Laptop hybrid graphics which are not platform-power-
manageable (older Optimus/ATPX or current MacBook Pro) will power
down the GPU but its current_state will be D3hot.  That's because
nouveau/radeon call pci_set_power_state(pdev, PCI_D3cold) and the
PCI core will only put it in D3hot due to the lack of platform-power-
manageability.  When the device is resumed, pci_update_current_state()
will now change the current_state from D3hot to D3cold.  I'm actually
seeing this on my MacBook Pro.  When the system is subsequently put
to sleep, direct_complete will still be afforded despite the changed
current_state because of the first patch in this series.  Works like
a charm, I'm curious if this causes issues for others, but I doubt it.

Hm, with PCI I can read the PMCSR and detect D3cold by reading the
vendor ID.  For generic ACPI devices, I don't have that so I have
to rely on the accuracy of acpi_device_get_power().  However as
you've pointed out, it might misrepresent D3cold as D3hot, and it
might incorrectly report D0 even though the device is in a different
state.  Is it safe to rely on acpi_device_get_power() then?

Another idea would be to use acpi_device_get_power() for PCI devices
without PM capability.  Then we could do away with the "state"
argument to pci_update_current_state().  This too hinges on the
reliability of acpi_device_get_power() of course.  At least D3cold
can be detected by reading the vendor ID, so we're not reliant on
ACPI for that.  I've even got a commit on my development branch
to make that change, but I can't test it, my machine doesn't have
PCI devices without PM cap.

Thanks,

Lukas
