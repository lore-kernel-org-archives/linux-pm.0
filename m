OK. Adding Peter to loop as it's his driver after all. Not sure
how well mixing regmap register access to the same module with
cached twl4030_read() would work :)

Maybe there should also be some big warning happening if
snd_soc_codec_init_regmap() is now needed and no regmap is
found?

OK. sounds like we should just revert the read and write removal
patches for now as they are now known to be incomplete for
non-regmap cases and cause regressions. That way we can deal with
them properly after the merge window and test them.

I'm not sure if adding back just the .read and .write is a safe
revert in all cases but it might be doable.

Tony
