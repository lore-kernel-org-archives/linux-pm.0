Right. I've no problem with the fact you want to make the threadgroup
more stable against subsystem attachment. Just please put more
detailed comments about what you are protecting. It took me quite
some time to precisely identify the race involved in that game in
order to consciously review your patches. And I'm thinking about
the next people who will work on this piece of code.

This:

 static inline void threadgroup_lock(struct task_struct *tsk)                                                                
 {                                                                                                                           
+       /* exec uses exit for de-threading, grab cred_guard_mutex first */                                                   
+       mutex_lock(&tsk->signal->cred_guard_mutex);                                                                          
        down_write(&tsk->signal->group_rwsem);

is really not obvious.

Just point out we want to synchronize against the leader, pid and the sighand
that may change concurrently.

Sure. I have no problem with that. I just wish we can precisely identify
what we are protecting against, and not have a foggy locking. Especially
when it's about such a very core issue.

I believe you can do it after using the cred guard mutex. That needs to
be double checked though. I think it was mostly there to keep while_each_thread()
stable non-racy against leader change. cred_guard_mutex should handle that
now.

Agreed.

Yep, fine for me :)
Just wanted to ensure I (and others) understood and identified well the issues
and the fixes.
