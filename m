I'm not sure who the "some people" you're referring to are, but I'll
assume I'm included in that group.

I don't think this is a fair characterization of the objections, nor
do I think "rejecting the feature altogether" is the only satisfactory
answer.  Speaking for myself, I find the idea of being able to suspend
while idle a valid objective, and certainly see the usefulness of it
for embedded systems.  I'm also an owner and user of an Android phone,
so I am certainly not out just to make life difficult for Android.

The primary objection is not the end goal, but rather the
implementation.  In particular, the problematic redefintion of what it
means to be idle, or "not doing work that's immediately useful to the
user" to use the phrase from the changelog (where "useful" is still
not defined.)

This (re)definition completely bypasses all current idle
infrastructure based on timers, scheduler, etc. and makes "usefulness"
defined in terms of who holds suspend blockers.  This of course will
lead to a scattering of suspend blockers into any drivers/subsystems
considered "useful", which by looking through current Android kernels
is many of them.
