Yes, it aims to prevent B from resuming to A's context no matter
whether it is on the same hardware or not, and prevents others
from getting the plain content on the disk.

May I know what attack does it refer to? please refer to another mail I sent to Pavel,
a simple use case has been described.

password generated key could also be used as encryption.
