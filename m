Heh, looks like this part of my E-mail escaped a little too early.

Thanks for the correction regarding the unit of the time interval.

To use the pagefault example, wouldn't that be partially dependent on=20
factors outside the control of the task that handles the input event? =20
(e.g., the time needed to page back in, or other code running on the=20
system.)

By "trusted," I mean processes that are run with a suspend block, as in=20
your example to Tony[1].  Isn't it so that Android has processes that=20
either run entirely under suspend-blocks, or which take suspend-blocks at=
=20
some point in time during their execution?  Wouldn't those processes need=
=20
to be prevented from a force-pause or force-freeze?

Tasks in TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE are woken back up when an event arrives,=20
unlike tasks in TASK_STOPPED, which are stopped until a SIGCONT arrives.
