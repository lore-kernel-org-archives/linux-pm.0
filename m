Here's a v2 with tentatively added Reviewed-by tags from Mika.

I've dropped patch [5/6] from the previous iteration as it didn't really belong
here and the issue it attempted to fix is rather theoretical.  I'm going to
take a different approach there.

Apart from this, the function previously called acpi_pm_device_wakeup() has
a different name now: acpi_pm_set_device_wakeup(), to possibly avoid
confusion about its purpose.

Also the changelog of patch [3/5] has been modified slightly.

Thanks,
Rafael
