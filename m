Indeed, I was hoping to find someone who knows more about PCIe in
general and it turns out I found one :-)

That is a good question and the person I managed to find tells me that
the values are already in the spec.

So there are really no B-states in PCIe. Closest thing is L-states which
are defined in the PCIe spec. The spec has two timing limitations:

 - After bringing the device to D0/L0 from D3hot/L1 there is a
   required 10ms delay after the write to PMCSR before any other config
   space access (5.3.1.4 in PCIe spec 3.1a).

 - After bringing the device out of reset, which is the path to D0/L0
   from D3cold, there is a required 100ms delay before accessing the
   device's config space (6.6.1 in PCIe spec 3.1a).

I also learned that both of these can be shortened with following
mechanisms:

 - PCIe readines notifications (6.23 in PCIe spec 3.1a)
 - ACPI _DSM method returning readines durations from  (4.6.9 in PCI
   firmware spec 3.2).

I think it is actually worth looking into the two mechanisms and try to
get Linux support them.
