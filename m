I still do not see the need to crash the entire system - OK, fine
cpufreq is broke, but the remaining part of the system can easily
function. That BUG does look like a ugly point and lack of proper
cleanup logic - cpufreq should be expected to report and gracefully
shut itself down, not screw up my platform boot.

For that matter we have had cpufreq working on TI platforms for years
now. I will eventually find time to track the issue down if no one else
beats me to it, but it kinda indicates that things are probably starting
to bitrot...
