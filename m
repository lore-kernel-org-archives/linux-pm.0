I think there's a problem with these patches where we no longer know
if the interrupts are wired up on a board. For example, if the USB PHY
VBUS interrupt is not connected, the phy driver needs poll the
cable state.

And on some PMICs some pins can be muxed to GPIO mode, don't
remember if that can be done with tps65217.

Tony
