so with the new settings it boots properly in either AC or battery mode wit=
h forced "lapic"?
Strange, one would expect this to refer to APM settings, but who knows...

Please test if booting with "processor.max_cstate=3D1" makes any difference

Please test if building with CONFIG_CPU_FREQ=3Dn makes any difference.

Also, please make sure that booting with "apm=3Doff" makes no difference --
there is a bug where the APM code is not currently disabled in ACPI mode,
and who knows what effect that may have...

Documentation/git-bisect.txt is what you want -- though if you can't
reliably reproduce the failure it may not easily lead you to the failure.

Also, it may be a good use of time to make darn sure that booting 2.6.18
with forced "lapic" when on battery does not fail.  ie. is this really
a regression -- of did forcing the lapic on this box never work reliably?
