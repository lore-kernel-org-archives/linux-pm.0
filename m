There are 2 minor difficulties with that:
1. The sdhci-acpi driver is not currently dependent on lpss
2. lpss does not currently export anything, so it is a bit of a new direction

If the ACPI HIDs used for SDHCI were unique to BayTrail (as the PCI device
ids are) then there would be no need to consult the cpuid. So it seems to be
a SDHCI problem, but I can't see a nice way to put it into lpss.
