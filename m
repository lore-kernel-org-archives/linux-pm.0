Hi Linus,

Please pull from

 git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rafael/linux-pm.git \
 pm+acpi-3.18-rc2

to receive ACPI and power management updates for v3.18-rc2 with
top-most commit a91e99e27a683608d221fb18b70d7de9d801de4a

 Merge branches 'pm-cpuidle' and 'pm-cpufreq'

on top of commit f114040e3ea6e07372334ade75d1ee0775c355e1

 Linux 3.18-rc1

This is material that didn't make it to my 3.18-rc1 pull request
for various reasons, mostly related to timing and travel
(LinuxCon EU / LPC) plus a couple of fixes for recent bugs.
The only really new thing here is the PM QoS class for memory
bandwidth, but it is simple enough and users of it will be added
in the next cycle.  One major change in behavior is that platform
devices enumerated by ACPI will use 32-bit DMA mask by default.
Also included is an ACPICA update to a new upstream release,
but that's mostly cleanups, changes in tools and similar.  The
rest is fixes and cleanups mostly.

Specifics:

 - Fix for a recent PCI power management change that overlooked
   the fact that some IRQ chips might not be able to configure
   PCIe PME for system wakeup from Lucas Stach.

 - Fix for a bug introduced in 3.17 where acpi_device_wakeup()
   is called with a wrong ordering of arguments from Zhang Rui.

 - A bunch of intel_pstate driver fixes (all -stable candidates)
   from Dirk Brandewie, Gabriele Mazzotta and Pali Roh=C3=A1r.

 - Fixes for a rather long-standing problem with the OOM killer
   and the freezer that frozen processes killed by the OOM do
   not actually release any memory until they are thawed, so
   OOM-killing them is rather pointless, with a couple of
   cleanups on top (Michal Hocko, Cong Wang, Rafael J Wysocki).

 - ACPICA update to upstream release 20140926, inlcuding mostly
   cleanups reducing differences between the upstream ACPICA and
   the kernel code, tools changes (acpidump, acpiexec) and
   support for the _DDN object (Bob Moore, Lv Zheng).

 - New PM QoS class for memory bandwidth from Tomeu Vizoso.

 - Default 32-bit DMA mask for platform devices enumerated by ACPI
   (this change is mostly needed for some drivers development in
   progress targeted at 3.19) from Heikki Krogerus.

 - ACPI EC driver cleanups, mostly related to debugging, from
   Lv Zheng.

 - cpufreq-dt driver updates from Thomas Petazzoni.

 - powernv cpuidle driver update from Preeti U Murthy.

Thanks!
