That is a valid point. Though we have pm_qos, should not that be the
input for these kind of requirement for a driver?

In other words, if the latency requirement can't be met for a device
while re-activating it, it should not enter runtime suspend state.

I agree, and has never been a suggestion from my side either, more
like a statement that I don't like the sysfs for runtime PM. :-)
