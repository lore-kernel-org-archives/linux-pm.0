It's done in two steps to strongly filter candidate child devices=20
against being children of a known platform device.  If you go around=20
that, you will be back to full device path matching with wildcards at=20
the USB child to determine if he is "the one".  So that's a feature not=
=20
an issue I think.

I can see doing it generically or not is equally a political issue as a=
=20
technical one, but I think if we bother to add this kind of support we=20
should prefer to do it generally.  It's going to be about the same=20
amount of code.

As Tony Lindgren said, even board-omap4panda.c itself is deprecated, to=
=20
project platform info into USB stack you either have to add DT code int=
o=20
usb stack then to go find things directly, or provide a generic=20
methodology like assets which have the dt bindings done outside of any=20
subsystem and apply their operations outside the subsystem too.

Yes I think it boils down to "buses" in general can benefit from this.=20
They're the thing that dynamically - later - create child devices you=20
might need to target with what was ultimately platform information.

On Panda the other bus thing that can benefit is the WLAN module on=20
SDIO.  In fact that's a very illuminating case for your question above.=
=20
  Faced with exactly the same problem, that they needed to project=20
platform info on to SDIO-probed device instance to tell it what clock=20
rate it had been given, they invented an api which you can see today in=
=20
board-omap4panda.c and other boards there, wl12xx_set_platform_data().=20
This is from board-4430sdp:

static struct wl12xx_platform_data omap4_sdp4430_wlan_data __initdata =3D=
 {
         .board_ref_clock =3D WL12XX_REFCLOCK_26,
         .board_tcxo_clock =3D WL12XX_TCXOCLOCK_26,
};

=2E..

	ret =3D wl12xx_set_platform_data(&omap4_sdp4430_wlan_data);

You can find the other end of it here in=20
drivers/net/wireless/ti/wlcore/wl12xx_platform_data.c

static struct wl12xx_platform_data *platform_data;

int __init wl12xx_set_platform_data(const struct wl12xx_platform_data *=
data)
{
	if (platform_data)
		return -EBUSY;
	if (!data)
		return -EINVAL;

	platform_data =3D kmemdup(data, sizeof(*data), GFP_KERNEL);
	if (!platform_data)
		return -ENOMEM;

	return 0;
}

when the driver for the device instance wants to "get" its platform dat=
a=20
it reads the static pointer via another api.  Obviously if you want two=
=20
modules on your platform that's not so good.

I doubt that's the only SDIO device that wants to know platform info.=20
So I think by providing a generic way we help other buses and devices.
