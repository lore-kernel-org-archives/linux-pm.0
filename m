Ok, I have missed we can get a shared irq.

We are definitely not in agreement on this point. It means I have to
rely on polling for card detection. I did it but I had in mind it would
be a temporary workaround while waiting to find a better one.

It will be a difficult task :)

To facilitate discussion, I copy a part of your explanation here:

So simply invoking the resume callback when the card detect irq is
received should be in accordance with the PM documentation.

Maybe it's a SoC specific detail but that doesn't mean that this detail
should not be taken into account. The PM documentation mentions 'the PM
core regards the device as suspended, which need not mean that it has been  
put into a low power state'. It sounds like we can access to the
registers, there is no requirement to disable all the clocks.

I am not arguing for SD card detection wake-up itself but for saving power
when I don't use my SDHCI controller. I boot Linux without a SD card,
the controller is runtime suspended, it seems obvious that the controller
should be resumed when I insert a card. I really want to use runtime PM
because the controller should be most of the time suspended excepting if the
rootfs is on the SD card.

Am I the only one to find that the constraint is too big to use runtime PM?
