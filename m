As far as I can tell (and its an extremely hard situation to replicate),
this is not true. My laptop sleeps and wakes straight back up.

The following cannot occur on my laptop for simple idling

	Alarm
		Suspend

because the Alarm resets the suspend timer when it is delivered. The wake
pins and wake logic also ensure that the sequence

		Suspend
			Alarm

always causes

		Suspend
			Alarm
		Suspend Finishes
		Resume

It's very relevant because it means that considering current laptops is
not that important because they can't do this kind of fast sleep/wakeup

The number of events is I think only partly relevant. What matters is how
long you wait between idle and suspending. The longer you wait the less
potential you have to end up with an event successfully owned by an
application you are not considering relevant to suspend.
