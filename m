Ooh, I'm already working on it.  I *think* I should be able to post
the patches later today or early next week.

Glauber had about similar question about css_id and I need to think
more about it but currently I think I want to phase out css IDs.  It's
an id of the wrong thing (CSSes don't need IDs, cgroups do) and
unnecessarily duplicates its own hierarchy when the hierarchy of
cgroups already exists.  Once memcontrol moves away from walking using
css_ids, I *think* I'll try to kill it.

I'll add cgroup ID (no hierarchy funnies, just a single ida allocated
number) so that it can be used for cgroup indexing.  Glauber, that
should solve your problem too, right?

Thanks.
