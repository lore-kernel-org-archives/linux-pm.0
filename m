Based on this, it sounds like igb_resume() should call igb_remove()
when it figures out the device is missing.

That might be the best we can do right now, but it doesn't sound like
a general-purpose solution.  Detecting device removal sounds like a
core function, not a driver function.  It doesn't seem like drivers
should have to implement ->resume just to deal with this case.
Calling ->remove from ->resume is a little strange and may expose
locking issues or races.  I suspect that most ->remove methods are not
prepared to deal with missing devices (they may want to stop DMA,
disable interrupts, etc.)

I assume that you do want to call the driver's ->remove method to free
any per-device state.  Do USB drivers just have to be smart enough to
do that without touching the device?
