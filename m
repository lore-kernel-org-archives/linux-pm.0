These should be separate driver instances for the control modules.

And then the ioremapped area should ignore at least the padconf
registers so drivers/pinctrl/pinctrl-simple can handle those. There
should not be any dependencies to the SCM driver from pinctrl-simple,
the core SCM driver can manage the clocks and trigger the save of
padconf regs.

Also we should allow MMC driver handle the MMC specific registers
and USB driver(s) handle the USB specific registers if possible. Those
should not live under drivers/mfd unless there are some dependencies
other than trying to ioremap the whole SCM module instead of ioremapping
in each driver.

We can have a static map for the SCM, so ioremapping each driver
individually should not be an issue.

Tony
