I agree.  The kernel has to figure out which wakeup mechanism(s) to use.

Well, the normal ACPI stuff.

On a full ACPI HW system if the device has an ACPI companion object and there is
a _PRW under it (and it is actually valid), then it points to the GPE that will
be used for signaling wakeup and from the device's perspective that is out of
band.  That is very much like having a sideband wakeup GPIO IRQ (except that
the IRQ is muxed into the SCI in the ACPI GPE case).

Cool, thanks!

I'll have a look at that soon (hopefully), but it looks like everybody had
the idea to send me stuff at the same time. :-)

Thanks,
