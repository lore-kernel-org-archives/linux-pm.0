Yes, that is correct. the sleep and wakeup time are dependent on the
power state we attempt (may or maynot achieve)

I personally toggle an unused pin using padmux register write with
weak pull up/down in controlled tests (mostly using disable =1 for
states I am not measuring), then capture pinctrl toggles using [1]
into a csv for many thousands of iterations then use the conservative
values. I usually do this at the slowest frequency to capture the
worst case values that i feed into cpuidle_driver.states.exit_latency
and appropriate value for target_residency - I usually ignore
power_usage as the value is never a constant and depends on quiet a
few factors that i cannot discuss in public domain.

Here are some helpful links on OMAP specific strategies (these may be
a little old, but just search for CPUIDLE latency measure in google)
