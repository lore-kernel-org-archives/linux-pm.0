The assessment above is entirely correct, I'm sort of abusing the
portdrv infrastructure as a way to bind to the upstream bridge.

For comparison, Optimus GPUs are also suspended to D3cold with a
non-standard method (i.e., not by the ACPI platform). The way we
handle that is to assign a dev_pm_domain to the device using
dev_pm_domain_set(). You can just think of "dev_pm_domain" as a
fancy name for overriding the callbacks in pci_dev_pm_ops:
http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/gpu/vga/vga_switcheroo.c#n1014

I cannot use that method with Thunderbolt because dev_pm_domain_set()
can only be called for unbound devices. And the upstream bridge will
already have been bound (to portdrv) when thunderbolt.ko loads.

I'm waiting for Rafael to weigh in if the dev_pm_domain_set() method
is the right thing to do for devices which are suspended to D3cold
in a non-standard way, and whether the "device not bound" restriction
on dev_pm_domain_set() can be lifted. If so, I could rework this
series to use that instead of binding to portdrv.

Apple's ACPI methods to power the controller up/down are located
below the NHI device in the namespace. I just use the ACPI_HANDLE()
macro to get from the NHI's PCI device to its ACPI companion's
handle, then find the methods below that. This avoids the need to
search the namespace for a _HID or _ADR:
