If I put the '#define pr_fmt(fmt)' line above all includes, I get:

    include/linux/ratelimit.h: In function 'ratelimit_state_exit':
    drivers/thunderbolt/power.c:93:49: error: implicit declaration of function 'dev_name'

This is caused by 6b1d174b0c27 which was introduced this August.


If I try to solve this by including <linux/device.h> before the
'#define pr_fmt(fmt)' line, I get:

    drivers/thunderbolt/power.c:95:0: warning: "pr_fmt" redefined
     #define pr_fmt(fmt) KBUILD_MODNAME " %s: " fmt, dev_name(dev)
     ^
    In file included from /root/kernel/linux/include/linux/kernel.h:13:0,
                 from /root/kernel/linux/include/linux/list.h:8,
                 from /root/kernel/linux/include/linux/kobject.h:20,
                 from /root/kernel/linux/include/linux/device.h:17,
                 from /root/kernel/linux/drivers/thunderbolt/power.c:93:
    include/linux/printk.h:260:0: note: this is the location of the previous definition
     #define pr_fmt(fmt) fmt
     ^


So it seems there's no alternative to the '#undef pr_fmt'.

This is intentionally pr_err for cosmetic reasons. :-)

With dev_err it would look like this in dmesg:

    pcieport 0000:05:00.0: cannot disable wake GPE, resuming

With pr_err it looks like this:

    thunderbolt 0000:05:00.0: cannot disable wake GPE, resuming

Thus, someone grepping for this error message will get a hint that
they have to look in drivers/thunderbolt/ rather than drivers/pci/pcie/.

The code of this PM callback is located in the thunderbolt driver,
which binds to the NHI, 0000:07:00.0.  But the PM callback is
assigned to the upstream bridge, which is the grandparent of the NHI,
0000:05:00.0.  The pr_fmt is crafted such that the KBUILD_MODNAME
("thunderbolt") is logged rather than "pcieport".  So I use pr_*
in the PM callbacks assigned to the upstream bridge and dev_*
in thunderbolt_power_init() / _fini() (which is executed in the
context of the NHI).

This is also much nicer for end users looking at dmesg.  E.g. when
the chip is suspended, it looks like this:

    thunderbolt 0000:07:00.0: suspending...
    thunderbolt 0000:07:00.0: stopping RX ring 0
    thunderbolt 0000:07:00.0: disabling interrupt at register 0x38204 bit 0 (0x1 -> 0x0)
    thunderbolt 0000:07:00.0: stopping TX ring 0
    thunderbolt 0000:07:00.0: disabling interrupt at register 0x38200 bit 0 (0x1 -> 0x0)
    thunderbolt 0000:07:00.0: control channel stopped
    thunderbolt 0000:07:00.0: suspend finished
    thunderbolt 0000:05:00.0: powering down

It would be confusing for end users if it would say here that
the pcieport is powering down.

We mimic the behaviour of the macOS driver here which polls up to
300 times with a 1 ms delay.  I've now extended the comment above
in my working branch to explain this.

Ok.

Ok.

That would be the case if thunderbolt_power_init() failed, then we
have to skip removing the GPE handler and all that.  I've now added
a comment to explain this.

I've also discovered and fixed a bug in thunderbolt_power_init(),
in the "cannot find upstream bridge" error path I have to remove
the GPE handler.

I'll wait a bit if there's further feedback and will post a
rectified version probably next week, after the merge window
has closed.

Thanks!

Lukas
