Well, it may confuse the platform firmware in general.

For endpoints this is not an issue as they always have been expected
to be in D3 before passing control to the platform firmware on S3
entry, but we've never done that for bridges by default, except for
PCIe ports with PM enabled (in which case the driver decides whether
or not to enable it).

As per the above, endpoints should be OK (or they are quirky if not),
but bridges are sort of a gray area.  PCIe ports for which we enable
PM should be fine, for the rest it's better to be conservative and
resume them IMO.
