pm_runtime_put_sync() doesn't do anything to the hardware if the usage
count was > 1, because after the decrement it's still nonzero.  Where
is the particular call of pm_runtime_put_sync() that you're interested
in, and what is the usage count when it runs?  It's not at all unusual
for the usage count to be > 1 during a probe.

Also, what is autosuspend_delay set to for your device?  And is 
runtime_auto set?

No, not really.  Ideally you would leave autosuspend turned on.  The 
delay would be long enough to that after -EDEFER, another probe would 
start before the delay expired.  But shortly after the last probe 
attempt, the delay would expire and the device would then be put in low 
power.

I don't think so.
