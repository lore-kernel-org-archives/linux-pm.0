In theory it is possible that a subsystem (e.g. bus type) will enable
runtime PM for devices without drivers and will (for example) put them
into low power states until the drivers are loaded.  Then, it makes
sense for the core to prevent such transitions from racing with .probe().

I'm not sure if this happens in practice, though, but also I'm not sure
whether or not that's used by USB.  Moreover, even if that doesn't happen
right now, it may start to happen at one point.

Thanks,
