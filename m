But who would make a phone without CONFIG_PM?  If you're sufficiently 
unconcerned about power usage that you turn off CONFIG_PM, then you 
probably don't care about getting excess input events either.

No, not strictly.  But it is closely enough related that people
shouldn't mind if it becomes part of the PM code.

My example above referred to support in a single driver, not support in 
the system as a whole.  By the same reasoning, since some drivers 
support system sleep but not runtime PM, system sleep must have nothing 
to do with PM.  :-)

If you want inhibit to be part of the device core rather than the PM
core, that's okay with me.

All right.  Then a design should be straightforward.
