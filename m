Seems like there are more files in the kernel source using the mixed
comment style for the SPDX identifier and I also prefer it over C++
only. Would you mind if it stayed that way?

init data from DT. What did I miss (some specific variable to assign)?
I just noticed some other drivers do the same and thought it's the
right thing to do.
