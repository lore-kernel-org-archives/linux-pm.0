The idle path assumes that the platform specific idle code returns
with interrupts enabled (although this too is undocumented AFAICT) and
on ARM we have a WARN_ON(!(irqs_disabled()) when returning from the
idle loop, so the user-visible effects were only a warning since
interrupts were eventually re-enabled later.

On x86, this same problem exists, but there is no WARN_ON() to detect
it.  As on ARM, the interrupts are eventually re-enabled, so I'm not
sure of any actual bugs triggered by this.  It's primarily a
correctness/consistency fix.

Thanks,
