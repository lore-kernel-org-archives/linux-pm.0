The code takes a pagefault. The system is idle while waiting for the
dma to finish.

It can't, but in my opinion if the event did not start processing in
1/2 second it was probably not time critical.

We want to freeze trusted processes.

Why is the method used for pausing the processes relevant? If the
process is paused it cannot process the wakeup event. The only way to
get the wake event to the process is to funnel it though a process
that never is paused.
