Very true.  At the moment, isn't it possible for the userspace 
ioctl PM interface to freeze processes without going all the way 
through to a system sleep?

I think you have oversimplified things a little, but never mind...

But they do know (or should know) that they don't intend to use the 
system in the near future.  It might be good to have a separate way to 
express that idea to the kernel.

The wakeup code does two things: It tells the system which devices 
should be enabled for wakeup when the system sleeps (as opposed to 
cpuidle, when all devices should be able to generate interrupts), and 
it tells the system when a wakeup event has just occurred so that the 
system won't allow itself to go to sleep before the event can be 
processed.

It's not clear what this means.  How can a user process wake the system 
up?  Are you referring to user timers?

Do we have a way (or want a way) to distinguish between user timers and
kernel timers?

> 3. preventing kernel code from keeping the system from entering idle

Relatively few kernel threads are freezable.  The ones that are tend to 
be involved in device management.  Did you have something specific in 
mind?

Not exactly "abort".  More like "stop processing their I/O queues".

That's an interesting way of thinking about it.  Thanks for bringing 
it up.
