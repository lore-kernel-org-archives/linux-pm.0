It's a framework design discussion. In my opinion the driver being
registered and the device becoming visible on the physical bus are two
completely unrelated operations. Especially in the Linux device driver model.

You have a generic driver that calls ac97_codec_driver_register() in its
module_init() section. This generic driver does (at module_init() time) not
know anything about a device instance specific clocks, regulators or other
resources. Resources are handled on a per device instance basis, and you
won't have a device instance until the device has been detected, which
happens in ac97_bus_scan(). So you have a cyclic dependency loop here.

Maybe we can just leave the rescanning out for now and think about how to
best handle it when the need arises.

I think that driver should be able to use platform_set_drvdata() to store
the pointer.
