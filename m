Oh, I agree. You'd _hope_ that the BIOS reports that as a separate region, =

and we could use that as a hint, but it's never going to be fool-proof. =


It's just much much better to try to figure out what the hardware itself =

thinks it is doing, rather than relying on a firmware engineer filling out =

the table to match what he _thinks_ the hardware is doing (or, more =

accurately, randomly scribbling values until Windows boots, at which point =

it's not his problem any more, and people ship the crap).

Some misguided people used to think that we shouldn't do our own PCI =

probing, but use ACPI instead. This is the same thing, except on a smaller =

scale. MAYBE the scale ends up being so small that we can figure out some =

reliable way without actually asking the hardware itself, but I kind of =

doubt it. Especially judging by the current situation.

Absolutely. I'd _love_ to have the region reported in the resource table. =

It's just that right now it doesn't seem practical, since the downsides =

are bigger than the upsides (and the upsides aren't _that_ big, since we =

require the thing to be marked reserved in the e820 tables anyway, so the =

resource tables do know about it, about as well as they currently can).

In the absense of a way to actually ask the hardware, we could perhaps =

modify the thing so that it does request the regions in the resource =

table, but _only_ if the e820 entries aren't there (ie the "config type 1 =

didn't even work" case).

Alternatively, we might choose to request just the known smallest region, =

because that should be relatively "safer". It's better than not reporting =

the regions at all, and while it's not perfect, it at least shouldn't have =

huge potential downsides from getting the size totally wrong...

Hmm?
