Thanks for you point out. But, I want keep this logic to avoid someone
create a runtime variable with the same name-SSID to confuse the key
generator in EFI stub.

The job of key generator in EFI stub is to generate appropriate length of key
for usage by later activities. It doesn't need to know how does kernel use
which kind of hash algorithm, so I think do not need record the hash function.

But, kernel should knows the exactly length of old key to decide if it needs to
use flag to trigger key regeneration process in EFI stub to create new key for
new length.

Only the other hand, the hash algorithm of hibernation was setted in kernel
compiler time even user can change  it, so I think to forward the key length
from querying efi variable is enough, don't need write the hash algorithm to
EFI boot variable.


Thanks a lot!
