we have tried in the past[1] - unfortunately that was just bandaid since
the existing OPP device tree bindings have very limiting behavior across
multiple SoCs.This was one of the reasons why we stopped adding more
OPPs, since we are hoping to see the new bindings[2] which is under
discussion settle down and help enable support for cases like that we
have on TI SoCs, iMX SoCs etc.

The fix for this should ideally be in u-boot - we are trying not to
introduce dts changes in the hopes that the new proposed bindings that
Viresh has on discussion comes to conclusion and help introduce new dtb
support with proper SoC description. allowing an SoC to enter an invalid
OPP is broken by design. we must attempt to curb it. unfortunately, we
already do have a broken implementation for AM335x, DRA7 in place which
went with the assumption that we will be able to do modifiers on top of
existing dt description and the hopes that [1] will eventually get
upstream. But, as is clear now, [1] has no future path in upstream
kernel. following the same broken path for newer SoC definitions will
probably very short sighted by us.

in my opinion, doing a temporary hack in upstream kernel is not an
elegant approach. I suggest helping review and approving Viresh's new
bindings so that we have a longer term solution is more the way to do this.

Just my 2 cents. Thanks once again for identifying the urgent need for
helping Viresh's series along - will be great if folks could help review
and approve his series to get them upstream and help all of us ARM SoC
variations along.
