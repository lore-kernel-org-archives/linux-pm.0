If we just suspend while the keypad scan is active, a second press of
KEY_POWER would not be able wake the device up. The gpio keypad matrix
driver has two operating modes. No keys are pressed: all the outputs
are active so a key press will generate an interrupt in one of the
inputs. Keys are pressed: Activate a single output at a time so we can
determine which keys are pressed. The second mode is entered when the
driver gets an interrupt in the first mode. The first mode is entered
if the scan detected that no keys are pressed. The driver could be
modified to stop the scan on suspend and forcibly put the device back
in no-keys-pressed state, but pressing additional keys connected to
the same input can no longer generate any events (the input does not
change).
