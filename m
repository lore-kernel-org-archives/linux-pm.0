Why not?  There's no real overlap between them.

Right, thanks.  I tend to forget about that.

In the direct-complete case may_skip_resume doesn't matter.

must_resume should be set to "false", however, so that parents of
direct-complete devices may be left in suspend (in case they don't
fall under direct-complete themselves), so good catch.

But it is sufficient to do that before the power.direct_complete check above. :-)

Yes.

Opt-out doesn't work because of the need to invoke the "noirq" callbacks.

The wording is slightly misleading I think.

In fact technically may_skip_resume may be set earlier, but the core checks it
in the "noirq" phase only anyway.
