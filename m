Moreover, this approach creates sort of a priority inversion between
the Thunderbolt driver and the ports, because the driver, which really
is a superior entity (as it corresponds to the switch as a whole) is
caused to bind to children of the ports (ie. PCIe service devices).

That leads to ordering issues in probe and then suspend/resume etc.

Or from _ADR if the device object in question maps to a PCI device.
