That sounds like an optimization though. We'd still have to disable
the deviec somehow after deferred probe gives up.

I think you found the real bug there. So the right fix is to
call pm_runtime_put_sync_autosuspend() at the end of failed
probe in omap_hsmmc. Let me give that a try here.

Can we add some warning to pm_runtime_put_sync() about that?
