So why not put in some stub or so? Auto-suspend/suspend-blockers is a feature, 
and drivers ought to be able to work without a feature as well. Keep the 
suspend-blocker changes in the android tree initially, and get the main body 
of changes out first, and establish a flow of timely changes. That reduces 
your maintenance burden and increases trust for future changes - a win-win 
situation.

In any case, this is not to suggest that the suspend-blocker bits are 
'impossible' to merge. I just say that if you start with your most difficult 
feature you should not be surprised to be on the receiving end of a 1000+ 
mails flamewar on lkml ;-)

That's nice!

Ah, googling for 'tegra2' gave me the magic URI:

  git remote add android-tegra2 git://android.git.kernel.org/kernel/tegra.git

I generally roam various trees for scheduler patches when i can, seeing what 
problems people are facing and trying to prevent more painful forks from 
developing. You have these changes there currently:

 d82647e: sched: make task dump print all 15 chars of proc comm
 5e3e0f1: sched: Enable might_sleep before initializing drivers.

Please submit 5e3e0f1. We can probably do that one even simpler, by turning 
__might_sleep_init_called into the only flag that __might_sleep() checks - 
i.e. not checking system_state at all.

Also, please submit d82647e, it makes sense too.

Thanks,

	Ingo
