No because I can't easily try it at the moment.

And I think it does not show what you expect.

Usually the iio_channel_get() fails and we have bci->channel_vac =3D =
NULL
which does not make problems in the irq handler and is catched in =
ac_available().

To make iio_channel_get() not fail we have to implement deferred probe
handling.

Ah, yet another bug.

Looks as if there are some race conditions and we are just lucky that it
rarely happens.

Or everything done devm so that irqs are released first.

Yes, that is what I almost proposed as well.

Except that you propose to move lines from INIT_WORK() up to

if (bci->dev->of_node) {
...
}

as well.

Looks good to me.

So if Sebastian or others have no more comments, I will prepare a patch =
v6 asap.

BR and thanks,
Nikolaus
