They both seem to fix the problem.

Right, the problem is the lack of suspend on the first probe. But
for having autosuspend timeout long enough for the next probe
would mean that we can't reset the PM runtime state in between.

As far as I can tell things work just fine if the failed probe
suspend the device at the end of the failed probe.

Yes.. That works too. I guess the thing to consider is if we should
make pm_runtime_put_sync() always sync along the lines of a patch
I posted earlier today. That could avoid quite a bit of confusion
as already seen in this thread :)
