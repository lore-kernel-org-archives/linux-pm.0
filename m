Just wanted to add yet some new findings while I was looking into this
regression.

So, the reason why pm_runtime_put_sync() doesn't idle the device in
these cases, is because autosuspend is respected and for some reason
the autosuspend timer hasn't expired.
I was wondering *why* the timer isn't considered as expired, because
the driver don't call pm_runtime_mark_last_busy() in the failing probe
case...

Then I realized the following commit was merged a few releases ago,
which makes the runtime PM core to invoke pm_runtime_mark_last_busy()
for us.

commit 56f487c78015936097474fd89b2ccb229d500d0f
Author: Tony Lindgren <tony@atomide.com>
Date:   Wed May 13 16:36:32 2015 -0700
PM / Runtime: Update last_busy in rpm_resume

So, this commit actually causes the devices to stay active after a
failed probe attempt.

I think it's a good idea to revert this change, but what to you think?

Kind regards
Uffe
