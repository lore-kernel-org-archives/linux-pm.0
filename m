But what if the device's own status is currently SUSPENDING or
RESUMING?  Do you want to fail when that happens, instead of waiting
for the concurrent operation to finish?  There's no way to prevent this
on SMP systems, because a wakeup request can arrive while a
software-initiated resume is in progress.

What you are describing is basically what autosuspend was intended to
accomplish (that is, formalizing the difference between "the device
just became idle, you should consider when to suspend it" and "the
device has been idle for a sufficiently long time, please suspend it
now").  Would the r8169 driver be simplified if it used autosuspend?
