Hi,

Sorry for the delay.  After returning from Japan I found my cable modem
basically dead, so I have no Internet access from home at the moment, which is
a bit inconvenient, so to speak.

We discussed this exact issue with Magnus and Paul during LinuxCon Japan
and the answer to it is that you can't.

Apart from the problem with user space disabling runtime PM, there is
a problem with subsystem callbacks, which accidentally doesn't apply to
the platform bus type.  Namely, calling pm_runtime_suspend() or
pm_runtime_put_sync() from a driver's .suspend() routine will result in
the subsystem's .runtime_suspend() routine being called, which is incorrect,
because the driver's .suspend() routine itself is called by the subsystem's
.suspend() routine.  So, if one attempted to call pm_runtime_suspend() from
a driver's .suspend(), we'd get:

(subsystem)->suspend() => (driver)->suspend() => pm_runtime_suspend() =>
(subsystem)->runtime_suspend() ...

However, the driver cannot assume that the subsystem's .runtime_suspend()
may always be called from withing its .suspend().  In fact, for many subsystems
this will cause interesting breakage to occur.

Well, I'm not quite sure this is the case.  You have to remember that
system suspend can happen at any time, so even if your runtime PM is used
around transactions, it theoretically is possible for system suspend to
happen while one of the transactions is in progress (unless you can guarantee
that the transactions can't be preempted).

This is incorrect (see above).

Likewise.

While it is tempting to try to get away with only two PM callbacks per
driver instead of four (or even more), it generally is not doable, simply
because driver callbacks are not executed directly by the core.

The only way to address the problem of code duplication between .suspend()
and .runtime_suspend() callbacks (and analogously for resume) I see at the
moment is to make those callbacks execute common routines.

Thanks,
Rafael
