Whoa!  That's not my understanding at all.

As I see it, opportunistic suspend doesn't bypass any code that isn't 
already bypassed by the existing suspend code.  Users can do

	echo mem >/sys/power/state

whenever they want, without regard to kernel timers and the scheduler 
(other than the fact that the user's thread must be running in order to 
carry out the write, of course).

I don't understand this at all.  What gets broken, and how?  In 
particular, what gets broken that isn't also broken by "echo mem 
>/sys/power/state"?

But the point _isn't_ to modify the behavior of timers and the
scheduler.  The point is to provide a way for the system to enter a
very low-power state as soon as possible while safely handling races.

Although the first sentence is true, I don't find it useful.  The goal 
of suspend blockers is to prevent the system from entering a low-power 
state until some important task is finished.  It has little to do with 
interrupt response latency or device wakeup latency.

As far as I can tell, suspend blockers are more or less a direct
implementation of the desired goal.

The userspace API has essentially the same goal as the kernel API.

That's true.  Where's the problem?  The system is _already_ at risk of
entering suspend at any moment, as I described above.  If the "timer
and scheduler based" approach can be adapted to do what the Android 
people want, then all the better -- but I rather suspect it can't.
