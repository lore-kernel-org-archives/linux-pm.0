Well, that's funny. :-)

The function we used in there used to be called pci_is_bridge(), as
per commit 46939f8b15e4 "PCI PM: Put devices into low power states
during late suspend (rev. 2)".

But then, it was renamed to pci_has_subordinate(), by commit
326c1cdae741 "PCI: Rename pci_is_bridge() to pci_has_subordinate()".

Next, a new pci_is_bridge() was introduced, by commit 1c86438c9423
"PCI: Add new pci_is_bridge() interface".  It is kind of hard to say
why that happened, because the changelog of that commit doesn't say
anything about the reason, but evidently the new one is not exactly
equivalent to the old one (as you mention).  The author of that commit
apparently was afraid to make that change in the PM code.

Now, I think what we do makes sense, because we want to avoid touching
bridges that have something below them (so as to avoid disrupting the
things below the bridge) and I'm not aware of any problems coming from
that.
