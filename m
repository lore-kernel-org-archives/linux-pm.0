In all other cases, behaviour is unchanged. The input device is not
marked as wakeup capable, therefore the user cannot mark it as
wakeup-enabled, therefore this code does not execute.

So a USB keyboard on an OLPC laptop would behave exactly as it does
before this patch, as would devices on other systems.

The only way this functionality gets enabled is at the code level (as
it does in patch 2/2), and then once the user has requested wakeups on
all devices in the chain.

Sorry, I misunderstood the question and answered "what happens if the
system is sleeping and you press and quickly release a key before the
system is fully running" - in which case the system wakes up and
delivers both events.

For the question you asked, regarding a key being pressed as the
system goes into suspend, the system wakes up from suspend
immediately.
I just tested this by holding the 'i' key down while going into suspend.
While the key is being held down, the system receives repeated
interrupts with data 0x17 ('i' key pressed). The system suspends, but
then immediately wakes up, and continues the flood of 0x17 interrupts.
When I release the key a few seconds later, a 0x97 ('i' released)
interrupt arrives.

I guess the more accurate way to describe the wakeup condition is that
it wakes up on any i8042 interrupt.

Again - other devices are not affected.

I'll look into this, thanks for the suggestion.
