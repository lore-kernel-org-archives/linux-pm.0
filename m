Hi

a few thoughts here:

Freezing user space stops CPU-hogging processes from running.  When the 
runqueue is empty, the scheduler can go idle.  This in turn allows the 
CPU(s) to enter low power sleep states via CPUIdle.

As I understand it, this is really the basis for the modern Android 
use-case for wakelocks and opportunistic suspend.  They prevent 
non-power-privileged userspace applications from keeping the system from 
entering a low-power state.  (Secondarily, suspend also prevents kernel 
code from running, e.g., timers set by filesystems, the networking stack, 
etc.; but problems here should be fixed in the offending kernel code, 
rather than hacked around, since some of the users of those timers could 
be important)

But suspend users don't know this either, since they can't predict when 
the next external wakeup can happen.

Having some kind of indication that the user is done using a device for 
the time being is definitely useful.  But that's separate from system 
suspend.  System suspend is just one of many actions that the system might 
choose to take when the user gives that indication.

Consider something like a screensaver.  Usually, the longer latency the 
wakeup operation is, the longer the screensaver waits before deciding to, 
say, power the monitor off, or put the system into suspend (as we 
discussed that Mac OS X does at LinuxCon Boston).  Similarly, if there is 
some background task that really needs to run, an intelligent system will 
not allow a power economization mode to prevent that from happening.

Isn't this configurable now without system suspend with the wakeup sources 
code?

The individual components of system suspend are definitely useful:

1. preventing userspace processes from keeping the system from entering 
   idle
2. preventing userspace processes from waking the system back up
3. preventing kernel code from keeping the system from entering idle
4. preventing kernel code from waking the system back up
5. requesting that drivers abort what they are currently doing

The main issues are that these:

1. are all bundled up into one operation

2. target the entire universe of entities that they manage, rather than 
selectively targeting non-power-privileged entities
