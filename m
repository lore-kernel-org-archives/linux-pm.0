From: Rafael J. Wysocki <rafael.j.wysocki@intel.com>

Define and document a new driver flag, DPM_FLAG_AVOID_RPM, to inform
the PM core and middle layer code that the driver has something
significant to do in its ->suspend and/or ->resume callbacks and
runtime PM should be disabled for the device when these callbacks
run.

Setting DPM_FLAG_AVOID_RPM (in addition to DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND)
causes runtime PM to be disabled for the device before invoking the
driver's ->suspend callback for it and to be enabled again for it
only after the driver's ->resume callback has returned.  In addition
to that, if the device is in runtime suspend right after disabling
runtime PM for it (which means that there was no reason to resume it
from runtime suspend beforehand), the invocation of the ->suspend
callback will be skipped for it and it will be left in runtime
suspend until the "noirq" phase of the subsequent system resume.

If DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND is not set, DPM_FLAG_AVOID_RPM has no
effect.
