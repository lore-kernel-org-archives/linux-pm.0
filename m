I think that will never happen.  Before ->probe(), pm_runtime_get_sync()
is called, so pci_pm_runtime_xxx() will not be called until
pm_runtime_put_noidle() is called in ->probe().  And
pm_runtime_put_noidle() should be done as one of the latest actions in
->probe(), after the normal probe actions succeeded.
