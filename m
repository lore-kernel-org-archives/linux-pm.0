Is it the same during charging?

And, as we already discussed it depends on the situation.

In addition, GSM power consumption runs in bursts and I don=92t know if=
 the sample
rate of the MADC is good enough to track that correctly.

Well, this again assumes that you can generate/control different loads
easily (e.g. turn on/off this and that peripheral) to check the voltage
drop. Sounds good in theory, but I don=92t want to do it in practice to
derive this parameter.

And, don=92t forget that the MADC signals are nosiy and don=92t have th=
e
best precision. So it is likely that you get wrong values.

As said, I think it is not worth the effort around the imperfect twl403=
0/MADC
charging system.

If someone wants precise data, that is what fuel gauge chips are good f=
or.
And we already have drivers for them.

BR,
Nikolaus
