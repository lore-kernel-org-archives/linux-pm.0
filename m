Well, you need a delay there FYI.  It's just a nit.

Where would the .c file go... SMSC is not platform, or even arch=20
specific chip (eg, iMX or MIPS or even x86 boards can have it), so not=20
arch/arm/mach-xxxx or arch/arm/plat-xxx or arch/arm.  I guess it would=20
go in drivers/usb or drivers/net.

Push in ARM-Land is towards single kernels which support many platforms=
,=20
a good case in point is omap2plus_defconfg which wants to allow to=20
support all OMAP2/3/4/5 platforms in one kernel.  If you "include" that=
=20
C file over and over in board files, it's not very nice for that.  They=
=20
anyway want to eliminate board files for the single kernel binary=20
reason, and just have one load of config come in by dtb.

So it guides you towards having static helper code once in drivers/ for=
=20
the scenarios you support... if that's where you end up smsc is less=20
good a target for a helper than to have helpers for classes of object=20
like regulator and clk, that you can combine and reuse on all sorts of=20
target devices, which is device_asset approach.

It also guides you to having the special platform sauce be something=20
that can go into the dtb: per-board code can't.  That's why device_asse=
t=20
stuff only places asset structs in the board file and is removing code=20
from there.

What you have provided is no less fragile if you allow "port1" and the=20
ehci-omap.0 to be set from the outside.

Unless someone NAKs it for sure already (if you're already sure you're=20
going to, please do so to avoid wasting time), I'll issue a try#2 of my=
=20
code later which demonstrates what I mean.  At least I guess it's usefu=
l=20
for comparative purposes.

 From the point of view of allowing it to be reused on different boards=
=20
/ platforms / arches, you are going to have to do something better than=
=20
have literals in the code.

Yes, you need a parent device pointer (ehci host controller in this=20
case) and the path rhs, but only stuff that is defined by usb stack=20
code.  Needing a parent pointer is OK because this stuff only has=20
meaning for hardwired assets on the platform, so the parent device will=
=20
always be known as a platform_device at boot time anyway.

The code I'll provide will work the same in sdio or other bus case, jus=
t=20
use mmc host controller pointer and the sdio device name the same way.

Yes if the ARM people will accept establishing more code in board files=
=20
that doesn't have a DT story.
