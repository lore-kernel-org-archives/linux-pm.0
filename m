If we all agree, do we need another confirmation?

In the variant without EPROBE_DEFER you won't see it since ac_available =
either
has a valid iio channel or NULL.

The problem is only if we add an EPROBE_DEFER return if getting the iio =
channel
fails. This seems to make trouble if we don't take care of it. There are =
certainly
several options to work around but IMHO reordering is the best one (and =
even works
w/o devm for iio - which should be added in a separate step).

And there is a strong argument for reordering to have the most likely =
failure
first (iio fails more likely due to DEFER than allocating an irq). But =
only if
we process the iio failure at all.

So there are one a little doubtful argument for reordering (driver bug) =
and
a strong one.

> As for me it more reasonable to move forward using smaller steps.

Well, I wonder what it does help to fix a bug which does not even become =
visible
if we don't add EPROBE_DEFER?

So I would count two steps:
a) add EPROBE_DEFER and reorder code to make it work
b) convert to devm for iio

Ok?

BR and thanks,
Nikolaus
