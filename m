How can it fail?  Even if the queue can't be stopped immediately, can't
the suspend routine block for a few milliseconds until the queue can be 
stopped?

No.  It should stop the queue.

Think of it this way: Somebody has just closed the lid of their 
laptop and thrown the computer into a backpack.  You don't want the 
machine to fail to suspend merely because an SPI queue wasn't empty.

Runtime PM is very different.  It is supposed to take effect only when 
the device is idle.  So failing if the queue is non-empty makes sense.

No, that's completely wrong.  The user can tell the computer to suspend
at any time, whether or not any suspend blockers are enabled.  Think of
the laptop-in-the-backpack case.

I don't know what you mean by this, but it doesn't sound right.

You also have to handle races.  What happens if your suspend routine is 
called, and at that moment an interrupt occurs, causing the driver to 
add an entry to the queue?

You're trying to over-simplify this, probably because you're not 
thinking about it in the right way.  To put it bluntly, suspend 
blockers should not affect with your suspend/resume routines at all.

The suspend-blockers case is exactly the same as the normal suspend 
case.  The runtime PM case does require extra checking.

No, it's mostly wrong.
