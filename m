Hi Lukas,

thanks for implementing this. I have tested it on my my MacBook Pro
with CactusRidge and got it to work with a few modifications. Saves
about 4 watts of power form me!

- My firmware does not provide the TRPE ACPI method, only XRPE. So
either TRPE is only post CactusRidge or it is only present in newer
MBPs. In any case the OS X driver looks for TRPE first and uses XRPE
only if TRPE does not exists. I suggest we do the same (but see below
for TRPE).
- The XRIN GPE fired immediately after the power was cut. The problem
seems to be that the controller takes a bit to shut down. The solution
is to poll until XRIL returns 1 before activating the GPE. On "Type 2"
devices the OS X driver polls up to 300 times with a 1ms sleep in
between (for me 1 or 2 iterations were always enough). Afaik no
polling is done on "Type 1" devices. (Fun fact: Compiling with the
kernel address sanitizer makes the kernel go slow enough such that
this is not necessary:)). Also the OS X interrupt handler checks XRIL
and only wakes up the device if it returns 0. This was not necessary
to do on my model - but maybe spurious interrupts can happen with
newer controllers?.


Concerning TRPE style hardware: It seems that pm is more complicated
here. I see a bunch of references to SX* ACPI methods (SXFP, SXLV,
SXIO) and have not jet figured out what they do. Maybe we should not
enable PM if XRPE is not present until we find someone to test it.

I don't have any experience with the runtime pm core. But the
thunderbolt side looks good.

As you have noted the "correct" place to but this logic would be at
the upstream bridge. Ideally the downstream bridges should go into
D3hot by themselves if no devices are attached. The NHI as well (did
you by chance check whether the NHI can be put into D3hot without
killing the thunderbolt tunnels?). And then the upstream bridge would
go to D3cold (and thus power down the whole subtree). If I recall
correctly there were two problems:
1. PCI bridges do currently not suspend themselves at all
2. How to teach the upstream bridge about D3cold.

(1) should be possible to fix? For (2): D3Cold always requires a
platform specific mechanism and the pci subsystem only supports ACPI.
Would it be possible to add an API to tell the pci subsystem that we
know how to put a specific device(tree) into D3Cold from a platform
driver [+CC Bjorn]? Then this whole thing would become a normal pci
suspend operation.

Regards,
Andreas

Bridges in Hotplugged TB devices might have the same PCI ids as the
"root" bridges (if they use the same TB chip). You probably should
check that dev is a bridge of the builtin controller (for example by
checking for the presence of ACPI methods, see the comment in the
other tb quirks).
