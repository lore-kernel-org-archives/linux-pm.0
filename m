But are these tunings things that we can usefully represent in a generic
API or are they specific parameters of the subsystem in question? I
don't think anyone has suggested that having tuning for things where
there are genuine choices is a good thing.

Well, I'm suggesting that we shouldn't have a standard userspace API for
this in the first place but should instead be doing things on the
subsystem or driver level. I'm not sure we can sensibly do anything that
works usefully for all devices.

We can't stop people doing questionable things out of tree but that
doesn't mean lowering standards in mainline is a good idea. Keeping
things out of tree creates a range of costs - the effort required to
write the code and update for new kernel releases, support issues when
the out of tree code causes problems and so on - and makes it clear to
people using the code where the costs came from. If the code looks like
it's standard code using standard interfaces much of that pressure goes
away.

This is similar to all the stuff that's going on in the ARM tree at the
minute - there's nothing we can do to prevent vendors shipping random
code of any quality in out of tree BSPs but we can set high standards
for the quality of code we accept into mainline and let the resulting
pressures push people towards mainline solutions.
