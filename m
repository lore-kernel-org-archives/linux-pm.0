Hi,

Well, I'm not any less busy than yesterday, as it turns out, but I'm expecting
that to continue tomorrow, so I may as well have a look at it now. :-)

Yeah, documentation is missing, which obviously is my fault.

That code is designed to cover the case in which multiple devices share
a "power switch" that can be used to remove power from all of them at
once (eg. through a register write).  It also assumes that there will
be a "stop" operation, such as "disable clock", allowing each device in
the domain to be put into a shallow low-power state (individually) without
the necessity to save its state.  Device states only have to be saved
when the "power switch" is about to be used, which generally happens
when they all have been "stopped" (their runtime PM status is RPM_SUSPENDED).

The "stop" operation may be defined in a different way for each device in the
domain (actually, that applies to the "save state", "restore state", and
"start" - opposite to "stop" - operations too) and PM QoS latency constraints
are used to decide if and when to turn the whole domain off.  Moreover, it
supports hierarchies of power domains that may be pretty much arbitarily
complicated.

A big part of this code is for the handling of system suspend/resume
in such a way that it is consistent with runtime PM.

For USB ports I'd recommend to use something simpler. :-)

Thanks,
Rafael
