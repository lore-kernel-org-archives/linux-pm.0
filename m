Which is is the 'saner' model?

But the actual code does not actually deal with any 'state 0', does it? It enters an 
idle function and then exits it, right?

'power state' might be what is used for devices - but even there, we have:

  - enter power state X
  - exit power state

right?

What we want it to be is for it to be the nicest, most understandable, most logical 
model - not one matching random hardware specifications.

( Hardware specifications only matter in so far that it should be possible to 
  express all the known hardware state transitions via these events efficiently. )

What do you mean by "makes no sense"?

Are they superfluous? Inefficient? Illogical?

By that argument we should not have separate fork() and exit() syscalls either, but 
a set_process_state(1) and set_process_state(0) interface?

Thanks,
