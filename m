Sorry, for the delay. Missed this somehow.

These have nothing to do with a cpu, so they don't belong here. Maybe 
the first is a property of an OPP table, but the second certainly is 
not.

I tend to think you should handle this with kernel code (bootloader 
really) fixing up the OPP table as necessary rather than putting in DT.
