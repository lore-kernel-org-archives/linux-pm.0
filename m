Well, the "I don't want any input from you now, because the phone is
going into a pocket" case?

It isn't stticlty dependent on PM.

Support for "inhibit" and lack of runtime PM support means that the
feature has nothing to do with PM any more AFAICS.

That's why I think it may be regarded by more than just PM.  It should
make runtime PM behave in a specific way if supported, but then it
should work withot it too, shouldn't it?

I think that the answer really is "yes" in general as long as it makes
sense to discard input without closing the device.

My understanding of "inhibit" would be "discard all input including
any wakeup events from now on".  It would be quite natural for runtime
suspend to trigger if that is set (unless disabled or not supported,
of course), but I don't think that this should be a requirement.

My opinion is that "inhibit" should affect PM, but should not require
PM to function (there's no technical reason for that).

Thanks,
Rafael
