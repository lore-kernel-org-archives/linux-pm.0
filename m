So in QoS modifications to android patches, the answer is "yes" ...
except that the current android patch set didn't actually have this type
of wakelock in it.

Android wants an idleness suspend block (or pm qos constraint) that a
driver can set to prevent the system idleness power govenor from
dropping into a power state too low for the driver, so in USB terms this
would prevent the states that shut down the clock.  For android, it
prevented shutdown of an internal i2c bus.

The one thing that does look difficult is that these power constraints
are device (and sometimes SoC) specific.  Expressing them in a generic
way for the cpu govenors to make sense of might be hard.

The USB one needs user input, doesn't it, since user hot plug might (or
might not) be one of the wakeup sources.
