Reading this again, I realize you said "internal registers".  I don't
know whether that actually means config space registers (which
*should* work even when the device is in D3hot (see the PCIe reference
below and PCI Power Management Spec r1.2, sec 5.4.1)), or MMIO
registers (which are not expected to work while in D3hot).

If the service tools read MMIO registers, presumably that goes through
some driver that should be able to manage runtime PM.  Or, if there's
no driver, I think your service tool could prevent runtime power
management by changing /sys/devices/.../power/control to "on" (see
Documentation/power/runtime_pm.txt).

Please repost this with more details.
