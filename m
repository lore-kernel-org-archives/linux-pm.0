I'm not sure these can be static inline since the symbols are exported
for use outside this file. However, in theory I have no objection from a
performance standpoint. Since my devices don't have such strict realtime
requirements as your 74x164 application, I'll defer this decision to
someone more knowledgeable in this area; perhaps someone else can
comment in this thread with their advice and suggestions.
