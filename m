That's an x86'ism which is going away. And that's really completely
irrelevant for the mobile device space. Can we please stop trying to
fix todays x86 based laptop problems? They are simply not fixable.

If you'd have read the answers from Alan carefully, then you'd have
noticed that even x86 hardware is getting to the point where OMAP is
today. i.e. support of transparent suspend from idle. If that wouldn't
happen then x86 would be simply unusable for mobile devices. It's that
easy. And we really do _NOT_ care about the existing laptop hardware
which does not provide that because it's a lost case. Not only due to
the missing (or just disabled) wakeup sources, also due to the fact
that you cannot do sensible power management by completely disabling
clock and/or power of unused devices in the chipset. There is a damn
good reason why the mobile space is _NOT_ x86 based at the moment.

Thanks,
