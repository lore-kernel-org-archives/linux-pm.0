I think keeping default to be 5 is good. As you mentioned it's a nice
round number and keeping it at the minimum also hints that this is not
a free resource and the more buckets you use the more you pay.
Documentation might say "to fit the full unordered array into a single
cache line for configurations of up to 7 buckets".
