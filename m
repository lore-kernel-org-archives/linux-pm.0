Are you still talking about Linux suspend? If you can enter S3 from
idle and still wake up for the next timer or interrupt, then do that.
Suspend blockers should have not effect on this.

Most apps does not have to know about this with opportunistic suspend
either. If the user is interacting with the device, we don't suspend.
If your apps needs to run when the user is not interacting with the
device, then you can block suspend.

Suspend as it is currently implemented in Linux is special. Regular
timers stop, and only specially marked wakeup events can bring the
system back to the normal state.

On a phone this is not the case. The user manually can toggle the
screen on and off, and we may or may not enter suspend when the screen
is off. If we forced suspend when the user turned the screen off, we
could miss phone calls.

I don't think a latency api is the right way to express this since the
only latency values we would use is minimal-latency and any-latency.
What we are expressing is that this works need to happen now, even if
the user is not currently interacting with the device.

We have two main modes of operation. The user is interacting with the
device and tasks and timers should run as requested. And, the user is
not interacting with the device and the device should enter (and stay
in) low power states regardless of running tasks and timers. Since
some events (e.g. incoming phone call, alarm clock) will may cause the
user to start interacting with the device, they need special
treatment. A per thread latency api does not work for us. A global
latency api could work, but since would only use minimal latency or
any latency this seem like overkill. Also, with a global latency api,
how do I know it the requested latency is meant to improve the
experience while the user is interacting with the app, or if it meant
the app needs to run when the user is not interacting with the device.

I don't think you understood what I asked. Currently most x86 systems
can enter much lower power states from suspend than they can from
idle. Are you suggesting that we remove suspend support from Linux and
try to enter the same power states on x86 from idle that we now enter
from suspend? It is not clear to me if this is possible.
