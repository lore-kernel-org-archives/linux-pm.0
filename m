That's exactly why I don't favor it!  :-)

I don't see how it would make runtime PM either more or less
understandable, since the proposed change affects system PM, not
runtime PM.  On the other hand, it would make the Runtime PM 
documentation more complicated.

(Also, I think the name "pm_runtime_no_prevent_suspend" is a very bad 
choice.  It should be something more like 
"allow_runtime_suspend_during_system_sleep".)

How is this an advantage?  Drivers can accomplish the same thing right 
now by not doing anything at all.

Actually, drivers would simply need to _avoid_ setting the 
.suspend_late callback.
