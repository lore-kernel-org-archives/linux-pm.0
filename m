The platform_device will be built as well as the omap_device. There
are hooks at the platform_device creation that will proceed with the
omap_device deployment. Please check:
arch/arm/plat-omap/omap_device.c: _omap_device_notifier_call and
omap_device_build_from_dt

As explained above, when booting with DT, you will get both, pdev and omap_=
dev.
