I think Thomas was suggesting that you consider creating a option for
where CLOCK_MONOTONIC included total_sleep_time.

In that case the *hack* (and this is a hack, we'll need some more
thoughtful discussion before anything like it could make it upstream)
would be in timekeeping_resume() to comment out the lines that update
wall_to_monotonic and total_sleep_time.

It would be interesting to hear if that hack works for you, and we can
try to come up with a better way to think about how to accommodate both
views of how to account time over suspend.

Thomas, might this call for a new posix clock_id, CLOCK_BOOTTIME (ie:
CLOCK_MONOTONIC + total_sleep_time) or something that userland could use
to set timers on?

thanks
