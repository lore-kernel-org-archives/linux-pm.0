It was similar, but not the same:

v1: Prefer kASLR over Hibernation
v2: kaslr: allow kASLR to be default over Hibernation

I'm happy to call it whatever you like, though! :)

Okay, right. So, there are a few problems that this patch is solving,
and maybe it needs to be broken up into separate patches, but it
didn't seem like it to me at the time. Specifically:

1) The x86 hibernation and KASLR code don't play well together currently.

"1" was worked around so that both could be built in, but only one
would be active at a time. This lead to:

2) The general hibernation code contains kernel arguments that should
only affect x86.

And we have the desire by folks to have KASLR enabled by default on
x86, giving us:

3) There is no build-time way on x86 to switch the preference of KASLR
vs hibernation.

I think "2" should be solved for this release, since arm64 KASLR is
landing, and mistakenly booting an arm64 system with "kaslr" on the
command line will needlessly disable hibernation.

3 and 2 are a result of 1, and IIUC, you're saying you want to solve 1
to make everything else go away? My only concern with that idea is
that I don't (yet) have the knowledge of x86 hibernation internals to
fix this, and it'll take a while to get to having KASLR on by default
if we have to wait on me to fix hibernation. (I'm not saying I
won't/can't, it's just that it'll take me time to come up to speed on
it.)

That do you think?
