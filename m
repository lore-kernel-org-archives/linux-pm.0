You should have mentioned this before!

One of those cables is for data and power, and the other cable is for 
power only (probably the thinner of the two).  For your drive to work 
correctly you should first plug in the power-only cable to a 1.1 port 
and then plug in the data/power cable to the 2.0 port.

If you mix things up and plug the data cable to a 1.1 port then of 
course the drive will operate only at 1.1 speed.

See if this doesn't clarify the matter.
