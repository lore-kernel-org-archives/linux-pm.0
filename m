Oops, I'm not quite right here. 

The doc is actually right here if the driver uses pm_runtime_suspend()
or pm_runtime_idle() in ->probe().  It's only when drivers use
pm_runtime_put_sync() where there wouldn't be an -EAGAIN, but that seems
correct.  Sorry for the noise.

I'm still confused about the usage_count increment around ->probe
though.
