In this specific case, we could use the Chamelium board to emulate USB
devices, automating the plugging of various USB device types at
different system states:

https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/testing/chamelium

We are currently working on improving LAVA support for helper devices
such as the Chamelium, mainly for emulating displays in graphics
tests, but it can be useful for exercising other kernel ABIs such as
disable_device_probe. The goal is to have the result of these tests
reported to kernelci.org for spotting regressions early.

Tomeu
