The usage count is 0 at that point, it seems the be the RPM_AUTO
causing the issues that we set at the end of rpm_idle().

It's 100 at that point, see the commented snippet below from
omap_hsmmc_probe():

	pm_runtime_enable(host->dev);
	pm_runtime_get_sync(host->dev);
	pm_runtime_set_autosuspend_delay(host->dev, MMC_AUTOSUSPEND_DELAY);
	/* NOTE: pm_runtime_dont_use_autosuspend(host->dev) needed here? */
	pm_runtime_use_autosuspend(host->dev);
	...
	/* gets -EPROBE_DEFER */
err_irq:
	...
	pm_runtime_put_sync(host->dev);
        pm_runtime_disable(host->dev);
	/* NOTE: suspend callback never gets called unless
	 * pm_runtime_dont_use_autosuspend() is called
	 * before pm_runtime_put_sync() above.
	 */
	 ...

But then what about the new reinit function? To me it seems that
we should not attempt to maintain a state from the earlier failed
probe. Or are you thinking we just skip the reinit if autosuspend
is set?

So should we just establish a policy that pm_runtime_use_autosuspend()
needs to be paired with pm_runtime_dont_use_autosuspend() for
pm_runtime_put_sync() to work?
