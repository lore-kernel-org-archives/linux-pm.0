well most drivers use platform_driver_register anyways. Other
subsystems, like e.g. i2c have converted all drivers already.
In drivers/power/ there are only three drivers using
platform_driver_probe:

drivers/power/avs/smartreflex.c - ok here
drivers/power/reset/brcmstb-reboot.c - looks ok, too
drivers/power/twl4030_charger.c - should probably be converted

All drivers would benefit of being probed again if they returned
EPROBEDEFER, but their probe function can't be called again if
they use driver_platform_probe, since the probe function will be
unloaded when it should be called again. Apart from that the
=2Eprobe function pointer is not set. Thus trying to probe the
driver again at a later point is "a waste of time" and "futile",
since it will definitely fail.

platform_driver_probe is not about probe-order, but about not having
the probe function in memory once the driver is loaded. So the probe
function cannot be called again. If you don't want this use
platform_driver_register, as most drivers actually do.

I guess we should add some coccinelle scripts for detection of
potentially broken drivers (e.g. everything requesting gpios/pinctrl
together with platform_driver_register).
