So this looks like a bug that has been hiding, but just exposed
because cpufreq-cpu0 (now cpufreq-dt) was not getting built-in since
before v3.18.

On omap4-panda-es, v3.18 with multi_v7_defconfig + CPUFREQ_DT enabled,
I see this:

[    2.062103] cpufreq: __cpufreq_add_dev: CPU0: Running at unlisted
freq: 699977 KHz
[    2.070404] cpufreq: __cpufreq_add_dev: CPU0: Unlisted initial
frequency changed to: 700000 KHz

No BUG.  But, in next-20141216,

[    2.083953] cpufreq: __cpufreq_add_dev: CPU0: Running at unlisted
freq: 699977 KHz
[    2.091949] cpu cpu0: failed to set clock rate: -22
[    2.097045] cpufreq: __target_index: Failed to change cpu frequency: -22

And then the BUG.

So the BUG() itself isn't the problem with this regression.  There's
been a fair amount of changes in the OMAP clk driver (including some
other regressions), so I suspect the culprit to be lying somewhere in
the recent OMAP clock changes.
