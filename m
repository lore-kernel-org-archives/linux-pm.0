Ick, hiding this in the power management code?  That's messy, and
complex, as Rafael pointed out.

Turning on and off at random times "new devices can not be bound, wait,
now they can!" is ripe for loads of issues and is going to be a pain to
properly maintain over time.

What's wrong with the facility that the USB layer provides today to
allow only "authenticated" devices to be enabled?  That has been used
for a few years now to prevent these "don't allow random devices that
are plugged into the computer to be enabled" type attacks.  Doing much
the same thing, in a different manner, is ripe for problems (how do the
two interact now?)

If you are worried about PCI devices, why not just implement what USB
did for PCI?  Or better yet, move the USB functionality into the driver
core, adding that type of authentication ability to any bus that wishes
to have it (and not break existing working systems that are using the
USB solution today.)

thanks,
