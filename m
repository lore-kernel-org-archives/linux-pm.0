Ditto the "tablet mode" of some devices such as the Thinkpad X41, or the
newer Lenovo Yoga, which should have their keyboards and touchpads
disabled.

If we used something like UPower to enable/disable those inaccessible
devices, we'd need a way of enumerating which devices won't be
accessible in those modes. Turning them off and back on should be easy
enough.

Cheers
