Yep, if the pm domain provider takes care of the bus clks, then it would 
work.

Am guessing that the clocks property in the DT node would be read by the 
PM domain provider and enable/disable during attach/detach callbacks.
If that is true, then any device tree nodes which are not children of 
"simple-pm-bus" and consumers of power-domain provider would enable all 
(including non-bus clks) clks twice. Once in the power-domain provider 
and once in the actual driver. Is this expected behavior from 
power-domains in general?

That was the purpose.


Rajendra,
Looks like qcom gdsc pm domain provider driver does not handle bus clks 
along with power-domain, Is this something we should do? Or the bus 
driver take care of it?


Thanks,
