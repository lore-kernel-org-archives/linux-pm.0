We also use suspend blockers for work that is not visible to the user.
The battery driver on the Nexus One wakes up periodically while
charging to monitor the battery temperature and turn down the charge
current if it gets too hot.

The user-space framework decides if the device is in an interactive
mode or not (on Android phones the screen is off when it is not
interactive). Input driver need to block suspend so the user-space
framework gets the event when it is not already in interactive mode.

I think it is more useful to say that suspend blockers annotate that
some event needs to be processed even if the device is currently not
in an interactive mode.

To me idle means that no threads are ready to run and no interrupts are pen=

I don't think we can plug suspend in as a cpu idle state. 1. we want
to suspend even the cpu is not idle. 2. starting suspend will cause
the cpu to not be idle.
