I have enabled the (not-too-useful) twl4030 charger on my n900, and
it seems to break boot with kernels
34c9a0ffc75ad25b6a60f61e27c4a4b1189b8085 and newer.

I'll probably not have time to investigate it further (charger not
connected to anything is not too useful), but maybe Neil wants to test
on his phone...?
