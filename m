After some sleep, I woke up and realized that the hole thing of making
the PM core skip invoking system sleep callbacks, is not compatible
with devices being attached to the genpd. Sorry.

The reason is because genpd may not power off the PM domain, even if
all devices attached to it are runtime suspended. For example, due to
a subdomain holding it powered or because a PM QoS constraints
prevents to power off it in runtime. Then to understand whether it
shall power off/on the PM domain, during system-wide PM it requires
the system sleep callbacks to be invoked.

So, even if the driver can cope with the behavior from
DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND, then what happens when the PM domain (genpd)
can not?

Taking this into account, this feels like solution entirely specific
to ACPI and PCI. That is fine by me, however then we still have those
cross SoC drivers, the i2c-designware driver, which may have its
device attached to an ACPI PM domain or perhaps a genpd.
