"stay in D3 over system suspend"? (just to be explicit about what "in
suspend" means)

It sounds like the question of whether leaving a bridge in D3 confuses
the firmware has a platform-specific answer.  How does the driver PM
handling know how to do the right thing?  Does it need to know whether
it's safe to put the device in D3?  Or maybe a device is never put in
D3 for system suspend if it has a driver?

But I'm just kibbitzing; since you merged c62ec4610c40, I'm happy if
you also merge this:
