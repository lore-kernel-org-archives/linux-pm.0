Here is a suggestion for rephrase the above:

 +	help
 +	  Thermal subsystem will issue a graceful shutdown when
 +	  critical temperatures are reached using orderly_poweroff(). In
 +	  case of failure of an orderly_poweroff(), the thermal emergency powero=
ff
 +	  kicks in after a delay has elapsed and shuts down the system.
 +	  This config is number of milliseconds to delay before emergency
 +	  poweroff kicks in. Similarly to the critical trip point,
 +	  the delay should be carefully profiled so as to give adequate
 +	  time for orderly_poweroff() to finish on regular execution.
 +	  If set to 0 emergency poweroff will not be supported.
 +
 +	  In doubt, leave as 0.

This cannot be negative. I think it better suits here:
 +	if (poweroff_delay_ms <=3D 0)

Let's avoid hidden unsigned round up issues here.

Despite the above, you can add my
