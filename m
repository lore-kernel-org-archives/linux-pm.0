Well, I prefer shorter ones.

So while I don't have a particular problem with appending the "_unlock" to the
"out", I'm not exactly sure why this would be an improvement.

If that's just a matter of personal preference, then I would prefer to follow
my personal preference here, with all due respect.  [And besides, it follows
the general style of this file which matters too IMO.]

But if there's more to it, just please let me know. :-)

Thanks,
Rafael
