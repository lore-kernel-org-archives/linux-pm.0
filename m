OK. So probably supporting the following two configurations
should be enough then:

1. One or more WAKE# lines configured as a wakeirq for the PCI
   controller

   When the wakeirq calls pm_wakeup_event() for the PCI controller
   device driver, the PCI controller wakes up and can deal with
   it's child devices

2. Optionally a WAKE# line from a PCI device configured as wakeirq
   for the PCI device driver

   In this case calling the PM runtime resume in the child
   PCI device will also wake up the parent PCI controller,
   and then the PCI controller can deal with it's children

Seems like this series is pretty close to 1 above except
we need to have a list of wakeirqs per device instead of
just one. And option 2 should already work as long as the
PCI device driver parses and configures the wakeirq.

Yeah and it seems that we should allow configuring both cases
1 and 2 above.

And with the shared interrupts we can't do the masking/unmasking
automatically..

Currently nothing happens with wakeirqs if there's no struct
wakeup_source. On device_wakeup_enable() we call device_wakeup_attach()
that just copies dev->power.wakeirq to ws->wakeirq. And when struct
wake_source is freed the device should be active and wakeirq
disabled. Or are you seeing other issues here?

Seems like we're OK there except for the race. But I still wonder
if could just get rid of wakeirq in struct wakeup_source. Maybe
all we need is to see if dev->power.wakeup is allocated for the
wakeirqs.
