If you disable LTSSM during suspend, it should be off when entering
this resume function, no?

Right, so maybe we can even cut down on lines of code by splitting and
reusing existing functions.

5) Take a look at the linux-pm list. ;) The power domain framework has
just gained support for multiple power domains per device. I think that
 is the right solution for this, as like you mentioned the PHY isn't
really a separate block on i.MX6, but part of the PCIe controller
device.
