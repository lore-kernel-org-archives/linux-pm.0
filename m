Yes, there is no necessary relation to power management. If you put
your phone into your pocket, you will want to inhibit the touchscreen
even if that doesn't save power.

Cancel, yes, going to low power is a consequence which needn't bother
the power subsystem. You need a callback. If there are spurious
events, the current heuristics will keep devices awake.
You must discard them anyway, as they are spurious. There's no point
in transporting over the bus at all. We can cease IO for input.

It isn't strictly PM. It helps PM to do a better job, but
conceptually it is independent.
