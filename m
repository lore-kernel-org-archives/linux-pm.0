That only works if a single user-space thread initiates suspend and
consumes all wakeup events (or if the user-space code that initiates
suspend implements suspend blockers), and even then the kernel would
still need to block suspend in same places as it does if the kernel
initiates suspend. If a wakeup event happens right after user-space
initiates suspend, that suspend must be aborted. By only initiating
suspend from user-space, you force this to be a polling operation.
