Cases where the driver wants to avoid runtime suspend (while the device
is active) because of bad wakeup support in the hardware can be handled
easily enough.  The runtime-idle or runtime-suspend callback routine
can check whether wakeup == off; if it isn't then the callback should
return -EBUSY.  Thus the driver can prevent runtime suspend without any
need to increment the usage counter.

We still need some sort of "inhibit" callback for cases where the
driver doesn't want to go into runtime suspend but does want to turn
off all I/O.  Should this callback be triggered when the user writes
"off" to power/wakeup, or when the user writes "inhibit" to
power/control, or should there be a separate sysfs attribute?
