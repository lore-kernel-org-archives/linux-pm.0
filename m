Absolutely not :D

Just GPIO is fine.

What is weird is if a driver with DT bindings not mentioning IRQ
and only probing from DT start implementing IRQ support, that
becomes quite inconsistent. So then max77650_gpio_to_irq()
should just return -ENOTSUPP
or something for now, then it's fine.

We can add the (complicated) IRQ handling later.

I am trying to eat my own dogfood here, I was sweating all
last night trying to implement a hierarchical IRQ controller.
There is no running away from that now. :/

Apparently doing hierarchical IRQs demand that all irq
controllers up to the top-level SoC IRQ controller support
hierarchical interrupts using the v2 version of the irqdomain
API, and currently it seems like the ARM
GIC seems like the only top level IRQ controller that can
do that.
