I really like the looks of this patchset!

Noticed that you have applied it for your bleeding edge branch, I
suppose that means you will get some "free" testing in linux-next?

Anyway, I have tested it for ux500 (including the genpd support for
it, available in linux-next). It works nicely!

I have also tested the two Kconfig options; CONFIG_PM_SLEEP (which
selects CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME) and for CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME (with
CONFIG_PM_SLEEP unset).

That brings me to a raise a question; why do we need to keep these two
configurations options? Couldn't we also have CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME to
select CONFIG_PM_SLEEP, that will further simplify things?

Kind regards
Uffe
