On the hardware that shipped we enter the same power state from idle
and suspend, so the only power savings we get from suspend that we
don't get in idle is from not respecting the scheduler and timers.

Triggering a full suspend (that disregards normal timers) from idle
does not work, since the system may temporarily enter idle while
processing the event.

If you freeze processes you need something like a suspend blocker to
prevent processes from being frozen. By having a process that never
gets frozen you could implement this entirely in user space, but you
would have to funnel all wakeup events though this process.
