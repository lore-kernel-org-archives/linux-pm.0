So I remember that differently.

My idea was to add a third value to /sys/devices/.../power/wakeup (in
addition to "disabled" and "enabled") so user space can indicate that
remote wakeup should not be enabled for runtime suspend for the device
(since there's no way to indicate that today).  I don't see how
/sys/devices/.../power/control might help here to be honest.

Thanks,
Rafael
