I should have been explicit here - we do not have DT entries for clock
nodes for OMAP. For example, compare:
git grep clocks arch/arm/boot/dts/omap*.dts*
Vs
git grep clocks arch/arm/boot/dts/imx*.dts*

The specific comment above was intended to see the following series
equivalent in upstream:

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/2195431/
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/2195421/
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/2195451/
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/2195441/
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/2195461/
