I don=92t see how to group them. Could you make a proposal?

Yes, that was discussed for a while for this driver=92s bindings leadin=
g to v4.

Which ones do you think are not generic enough?

Ah, do you mean with generic/not generic the distinction between a =93t=
i,=94 prefix
and no prefix?

Well, I don=92t know if there is such an agreement and I would have no =
argument
against calling it =93ti,capacity-uah=94.

Well, many batteries and systems have a fuel gauge chip (e.g. bq27000).=
 This
chip =93knows=94 the capacity. But therefore it is not needed to specif=
y
it anywhere because it can be read out (usually in uAh).

This driver is to solve the issue that there is no such factory-program=
med
battery or fuel gauge chip connected to a twl4030 driver. Nobody can pr=
ogram
that capacity value - except someone matching the device tree with real=
 hardware.

And, by doing and averaging some charge-discharge cycles the fuel gauge
mapping is calibrated.

Every battery setup has a different map (which also might depend on the
series resistance of the battery and the wiring).

They are not really driver specific, they are battery specific. They
describe properties of the battery:

* capacity - depends on battery
* voltage depending on current charging level - depends on battery (and=
 differs between charging and discharging)
* wiring of MADC inputs to the twl4030 is board dependent.

So all these properties are not driver specific, but describe hardware.
And therefore they had been introduced exactly this way into the old
platform_data driver.

So if you want to see a =93ti," prefix to the capacity property I would=
 be
fine.

Nikolaus
