The idea here was not to touch the existing OPP bindings, hence the opp 
"modifier" name. As Nishanth stated, this is not extending the binding; 
the opp-modifier just uses the frequency values as an identifier but the 
driver does not necessarily care where the OPPs already in the table 
came from, just that they correspond to the same frequencies it 
describes. And again, just to reiterate, nothing is binding the user to 
use the opp-modifier-reg child driver, any driver could be written to 
decide which OPPs to enable or disable.

With that said, I do understand that this is far from a perfect solution 
to the issue of defining which OPPs are available, I meant it as a 
suggestion for a possible way forward. This could be used as a starting 
point for something even more generic. It's a common problem on many 
SoCs even if it is defined in completely different ways so this 
framework or one like it could give a common point to branch out from.

If we don't want to move forward with a generic layer to handle OPP 
availability, what is the best option? Does anybody else have opinions 
on this? Regardless of what is decided if everyone can agree on a 
direction we can all move forward.

Dave
