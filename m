The difference between echo mem > /sys/power/state and suspend blocks
is that with suspend blocks the system keeps running. And that's why 
it should be handled by runtime power management instead.

The suspend blocks seems like a hack to spam filter good and bad
apps from timer usage point of view. Applications are categorized
as good or bad depending if they grab a susped blocker or not.

I believe categorizing the apps should be instead done with some
timer flags or cgroups instead.

Cheers,

Tony
