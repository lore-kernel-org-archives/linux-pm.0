how better is this way compared to having the access functions in the
core? This way we just replicate the access functions in every
children.

I believe the suggestion was to have the ioremap and request done in
chunks. So that children dont step into each other ioarea. But then
again that can be a bit painful as the children registers are not
contiguous.
