It can still re-use its runtime PM callbacks, simply by calling
pm_runtime_force_ from its system sleep callbacks.

Drivers already do that today, not only to deal with wakeups, but
generally when they need to deal with some additional operations.

If we can find a different method that both avoids both open coding
and offers the optimize system-wide PM path at resume, I am open to
that.

Hehe, yeah you may be right. :-)

Yes, I will have look.

Agree.

Agree.
