Commit 58a1fbbb2ee8 ("PM / PCI / ACPI: Kick devices that might have been
reset by firmware") added a runtime resume for devices that were runtime
suspended when the system entered sleep.

The motivation was that devices might be in a reset-power-on state after
waking from system sleep, so their power state as perceived by Linux
(stored in pci_dev->current_state) would no longer reflect reality.
By resuming such devices, we allow them to return to a low-power state
via autosuspend and also bring their current_state in sync with reality.

However for devices that are *not* in a reset-power-on state, doing an
unconditional resume wastes energy.  A more refined approach is called
for which issues a runtime resume only if the power state after
direct-complete is shallower than it was before. To achieve this, update
the device's current_state by querying the platform firmware and reading
its PMCSR.
