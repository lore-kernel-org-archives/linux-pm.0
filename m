I was looking for some code that can be used between OF and ACPI rather than
duplicating the code in two different places just to extract some information
from the platform firmware. 

My initial look at your code suggested it to be very generic except the IRQ
read function. 

I was expecting that the kernel's PCI Wake handling to be common whether the IRQ
information is coming from DT/ACPI.

There are different approaches to portability.

* One approach is to keep of specific stuff in OF directory. 
* Another approach is keep some common code can call it from multiple platform firmware
or from the ARCH directory.
* Another approach is have one file but put OF and ACPI specific pieces at the bottom.

It depends on the code. 

Bjorn should chime in here with his preference.
