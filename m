When the PCI device is runtime resumed, the function call above
will be executed by pci_pm_runtime_resume(), so WoL will be disabled
as well.

There are a few drivers which re-enable WoL from their ->shutdown
hook, but that isn't impacted by this patch because the fast path
isn't taken if the driver has a ->shutdown hook.

Hm, why does the device have to be resumed for that?  The ACPI 6.0 spec
says for _DSW:

"This control method can only access Operation Regions that are either
always available while in a system working state or that are available
when the Power Resources referenced by the _PRW object are all ON."

Before _DSW is executed, all power resources are turned on, so whatever
_DSW does, the device should be powered up and accessible.  Does OSPM
really have to runtime resume the device for _DSW?


Another potential issue that crossed my mind is I/O virtualization:
If a PCI device is passed through to a guest VM, the VM may enable
PME, put the device in D3, etc.  If the VM is shut down, can anything
go wrong if the fast path is taken for runtime suspended devices?
(To be fair, if the VM crashes and doesn't shut down passed through
devices orderly, we'd be in the same situation.)  PME would be disabled
as described above, and leaving the device in D3hot should be fine as well.
If the host or another guest VM wants to use the PCI device afterwards,
it will resume it to D0 with pci_enable_device() in the driver's ->probe
hook.  Let me know if you find flaws in this line of thought.

Thanks!

Lukas
