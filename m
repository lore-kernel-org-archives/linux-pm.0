The clumsy thing is that we'd take the target_state as D3cold only if
the device already was in that state.

Otherwise, we'd take D3hot as the target state for the same device,
which doesn't seem particularly consistent to me.

Not that I have better ideas ATM, but then the current code works for
my use cases. :-)
