I think associating ULPI PHY reset and SMSC power and reset with the hu=
b=20
port power state is good.  Then, you could have the driver in a device=20
with multiple onboard USB devices, and individually control whether=20
they're eating power or not.  In the asset case, you'd associate mux=20
assets with ehci-omap.0.

Yesterday I studied the hub port code and have a couple of patches, one=
=20
normalizes the hub port device to have a stub driver.

The other then puts hub port power state signalling into runtime_pm=20
handlers in the hub port device.  Until now, actually there's no code i=
n=20
hub.c to switch off a port.

Assuming that's not insane, what should the user interface to disable a=
=20
port power look like, something in sysfs?  Until now it doesn't seem to=
=20
exist.

We shouldn't get to tied up with Panda case, this will be there for all=
=20
cases like PCs etc.  It should work well if there are multiple ports=20
with onboard assets.

USB device names contain the port information.  The matching scheme I=20
have currently just uses the right-hand side of the path information an=
d=20
nothing that is not defined by the USB subsystem.  It uses a=20
platform_device ancestor to restrict matches to descendants of the righ=
t=20
host controller.  So unlike try#1 the names are as stable as the=20
subsystem code alone, however stable that is, it's not exposed to=20
changes from anywhere else.  As you mention it's then workable on any=20
dynamically probed bus.

Currently I am experimenting with having the asset pointer in struct=20
device, but migrating the events into runtime_resume and=20
runtime_suspend.  If it works out that has advantages that assets follo=
w=20
not just the logical device existence but the pm state of the device=20
closely.

It also allows leveraging assets directly to the hub port runtime_pm=20
state, so they follow enable state of the port without any additional c=
ode.

They should be regulators for that I think.  But it's only part the=20
problem since clocks and mux are also going to be commonly associated=20
with device power state, and indeed are in Panda case.

I realize restricting the scope is desirable to get something done, but=
=20
I'm not sure supporting regulators only is enough of the job.

I agree, however I can't get insight into and confidence about what to=20
do without studying and meddling with the code.  Some throwaway code is=
=20
probably a reasonable price.
