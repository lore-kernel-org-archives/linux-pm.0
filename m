I'd like to provide some background and comments here.

1) OMAP platform is PM runtime centric - in other words all device's
PM operations (power on/off) are done through PM runtime calls and devices
drivers do not really change device's Power states during suspend/resume
- just do preparation for suspend. The final disabling of devices is done
form _od_suspend_noirq() or if device driver calls pm_runtime_force_suspend()
directly during suspend.

2) Initially all this suspend_noirq code was introduced due to commit

commit 1e2ef05bb8cf851a694d38e9170c89e7ff052741
Author: Rafael J. Wysocki <rjw@sisk.pl>
Date:   Wed Jul 6 10:51:58 2011 +0200

    PM: Limit race conditions between runtime PM and system sleep (v2)

which blocks PM runtime during suspend resume. And, at that time, there were
no pm_runtime_force_suspend/resume() neither proper support for power domains.

As result, below two calls really switch OFF device and its state should be 
RPM_SUSPENDED as it will reflect real PM state of HW:
	m_generic_runtime_suspend(dev)
	omap_device_idle(pdev);

In general, now the code in _od_resume/resume_noirq() callback is
equivalent to pm_runtime_force_suspend/resume().

3) It's expected to ignore -EBUSY return code from pm_generic_runtime_suspend(dev)
in _od_suspend_noirq(), as such code (-EBUSY) tells OMAP device framework that 
device should be kept active during suspend (for example 
serial device in case of "no_console_suspend").

commit 4b7ec5accecdb136c7afaf8739a06d5335cc05aa

    arm: omap2+: omap_device: remove no_idle_on_suspend

As result, when "runtime PM trying to suspend device but active child" happens
the OMAP device framework will ignore it and gracefully continue to suspend where
target device will finally powered off (depending on suspend mode and device). 
On resume, target device will not be powered on, because its state was not marked as
OMAP_DEVICE_SUSPENDED, so further attempts to power on device with pm_runtime_get_sync()
will be a NOP (because device state is RPM_ACTIVE) and any access to the device will fail
(system crash).

4) Unfortunately, commit a8636c89648a ("PM / Runtime: Don't allow to suspend a
 device with an active child") "breaks" OMAP suspend functionality (or
 makes visible more fundamental issues of PM runtime vs Sys suspend), because
 not all Kernel subsystem (especially USB) maintain their devices PM runtime
 state properly during suspend, which cause pm_runtime_set_suspended() (or
 pm_runtime_force_suspend()) to return -EBUSY and, as result, misbehave of
 OMAP device framework. 


My personal thought here is that removing of pm_runtime_set_active() will not fix
root cause of the problem, but rather hide it :( and, probably, real fix will be 
to update USB framework to ensure that all suspend devices are also PM runtime suspend
(not sure how) or add few more pm_suspend_ignore_children() calls 
 (for example as I've tried to do in [2], but this was unfinished).

I've found very simple steps to reproduce suspend failure on am335x-evm (should also
work on BBB) -  do below sequence with USB device plugged:

   echo platform > /sys/power/pm_test 
   echo 1 > /sys/power/pm_print_times 
   [ echo 0 > /sys/module/printk/parameters/console_suspend ]
   echo mem > /sys/power/state 

[   95.499685] calling  47400000.usb+ @ 733, parent: ocp
[   95.504818] am335x-usb-childs 47400000.usb: runtime PM trying to suspend device but active child
[   95.513750] am335x-usb-childs 47400000.usb: omap device suspend failure 0

Below I've attached possible patch which converts OMAP device to
use pm_runtime_force_suspend/resume().

Subject: [PATCH] ARM: OMAP2+: omap_device: use pm runtime force api in noirq
 callbacks

The current implementation of _od_suspend_noirq and _od_resume_noirq
callbacks is duing actually the same things as
pm_runtime_force_suspend/resume() when it disables currently active
devices, so convert those callbacks to use
pm_runtime_force_suspend/resume().
