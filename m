The specific case I hit was a critical temperature event as soon as
the hwmon device was probed (the driver tmp102 was a kernel module).

Probably needs a rephrase.

I am not sure if this #ifdeffery is even needed.


Eduardo, Rui: If this is not the suggested technique, maybe you guys
could suggest how we could handle a case where userspace might be
hungup due to some reason and a case where a critical temperature
event in the middle of device probe was triggered?

Obviously, we'd like to take into consideration userspace latencies as
well- but that is very specific to fs being run.. not really a simple
problem, IMHO..

I think documentation is necessary that we are hoping for bootloader
to be able to detect and halt as needed -> risk here obviously is an
infinite reboot loop :( .
