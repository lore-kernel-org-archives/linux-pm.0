Hello, Oleg.

PF_KTHREAD no longer gets TIF_SIGPENDING set, so...

Can you elaborate on it being wrong?  Do you mean the possibility of
leaking spurious TIF_SIGPENDING?

Yeap, it doesn't really matter.  In most cases userland tasks would
get parked in the signal delivery path anyway and if a task is deep in
the kernel, it should and usually does hit syscall restart path.
Except for few special cases (maybe some of unfailable NFS calls),
there'userland tasks shouldn't take try_to_freeze() path outside of
signal delivery / job control path.

Also, in general, I don't think it's a good idea to add non-trivial
optimization like above to code path which is as cold as it gets
without any backing data.  The PM freezer used to busy loop until all
tasks enter refrigerator.  Nobody cares whether some tasks enter
signal delivery path one more time.

Yeay. :)

Thanks.
