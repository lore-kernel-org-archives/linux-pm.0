It was impossible to wake-up on card detect event because when sdhci
controller is runtime suspend, it is assumed that all the clocks are
disabled so we can't get irqs.
If the device is removable and there is no gpio to manage the card
detection then card detection polling is used.

Hi Ulf, Adrian,

Following the discussion, I need to fix my issue. I think we could both agree
on this patch that I see more as temporary workaround.

I will try to change the muxing of the card detect pio in order to no more
use the sdhci controller to manage it but a gpio. If it do not work then
I may send another patch in the spirit of the previous one (keeping one clock
enabled and not calling sdhci_runtime_suspend_host()).

Regards
