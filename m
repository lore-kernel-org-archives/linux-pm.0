As Ard and James's comments, the EFI key can not be accepted:
	https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/8/5/135

The lower entropy problem can be covered by RDRAND or EFI random
protocol. But the key point is that we can not fully trust manufacturer.
And, the secure boot relies on Microsoft's business interests. It's
not designed for confidentiality.

So I will move to TPM trusted key + encrypted key.

Sounds there have two different purposes. One is to prevent that
the secret in snapshop image be detected/changed outside the machine.
Another one try to prevent that B user resumes to A user's context
on the same machine.

In the case of B resumes A's context, I still think that the attacker
must physical accesses the machine. Which means that it's out of EFI
secure boot's design. Could you please explan the detail for the attack?

So I think that the password from user space is for user authentication,
and the TPM trusted key is for snapshot image encryption/verification.
