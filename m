No, they don't go into D3cold.  They can go into D3hot, however.

PME, for one, is not an endpoint capability.  It very specifically is
defined as a port capability AFAICS, and the whole idea here is that
endpoints will not use their in-band interrupts to signal PME.  That
is supposed to be done by ports.

We can, at least in principle.

More precisely, the spec requires PME and hotplug to use the same interrupt
(please see the comment in pcie_port_enable_msix() on that), but AER can use
a different one.

That is why AER, PME and hotplug are all supposed to be signaled by ports,
possibly among other things.
