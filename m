Which user are you talking about?

AFAIK for Panda we only need a regulator and a clock for each root port.
IMHO we should just use the existing regulator and clock frameworks.

True. e.g. the same regulator could be used to power 3 root hub ports in
a ganged setup. But the regulator framework is sufficient to deal with
that. Each port will call regulator_get() and regulator_enable() and the
physical regulator won't be disabled till all of them have called
regulator_disable().
