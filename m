Because it wouldn't work.  The job of the runtime_idle callback is to
call pm_runtime_suspend when needed.  But if the callback runs under
the spinlock then pm_runtime_suspend would hang when it tries to grab
the lock.

I don't think Linus will object to this.  What he doesn't like is when
some code drops a lock, reacquires it, and then behaves as though the
lock had been held all along.  That's not the case here; rpm_idle()  
does not depend on any state remaining unchanged across the callback.
