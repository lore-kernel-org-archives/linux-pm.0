Ah, perfect.  That's exactly what's supposed to happen from a PCI
hardware point of view.  Unfortunately I don't know much about how
Linux power management works, but Rafael and Mika do.

How do your service tools access these MMIO registers?

  - via a PLX driver that provides read/write/ioctl on a char dev?
  - read/write on /sys/devices/pci*/.../resource<x> ?
  - mmap on /sys/devices/pci*/.../resource<x> ?
  - read/write on /dev/mem?
  - mmap on /dev/mem?
  - something else?

I think there are several ways we might be able to fix this:

  - Write a driver along the lines of drivers/pci/switch/switchtec.c.
    I don't see any runtime PM stuff in that driver, so maybe it's
    magically taken care of by the PM/PCI core?  There might also be
    an issue if both portdrv and your driver want to claim the same
    device.  I don't know how switchtec deals with that.

  - Maybe the PCI sysfs accessors (pci_mmap_resource(), etc) should
    turn off runtime PM?  If we allow mmap of a BAR and then put the
    device in D3hot, that seems like a bug that could affect lots of
    things.  But maybe that's already done magically elsewhere?
