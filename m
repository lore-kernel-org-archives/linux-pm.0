Hi All,

This series is a replacement for commit eed4d47efe95 (ACPI / sleep: Ignore
spurious SCI wakeups from suspend-to-idle) which is still there in 4.12-rc4 but
will be reverted shortly, because it triggered issues on quite a few systems.

The last patch in the series is a counterpart of the above commit with a few
modifications, mostly to avoid affecting suspend-to-RAM and to reorder messages
printed to kernel logs to make them somewhat less confusing.

The previous patches are pre-requisite changes plus some cleanups.  The major
ones are [1-2/6] and [4/6] that are really needed for things to work as expected
after [6/6].

In addition to that, this patch from Hans: https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9762815/
is needed for USB wakeup on Bay Trail and Cherry Trail systems to work in general.

Thanks,
Rafael
