That said, I think we may do something different that perhaps will make your
life somewhat easier.

Namely, if your driver doesn't implement any system suspend callbacks
(i.e. ->suspend(), ->resume(), ->freeze(), ->thaw() etc.) and it doesn't
want the analogous subsystem callbacks to be executed for the device, it will
make sense to flag the device as "runtime only", or something like this,
which make the PM core skip the device in dpm_suspend() etc.

In that case, if a device if flagged as "runtime only", we can avoid
calling pm_runtime_get_noirq() for it in dpm_prepare() and, analogously,
calling pm_runtime_put_sync() for it in dpm_complete().  However, we will have
to fail system suspend (or hibernation) if a "runtime only" device has the
power.runtime_auto flag unset.

So, I think we can add a "runtime only" flag working as described above.
I guess it will also help in the case I've been discussing with Kevin for some
time (i2c device using runtime PM used by an RTC in a semi-transparent
fashion).

Alan, what do you think?
