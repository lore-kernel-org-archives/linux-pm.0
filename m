Hi Rafael,

Sorry once again on the delays...My email hygiene has been getting bad,
so mail gets buried.

Probably :) And my DT structure may not be correct. But it's easily
available to review. See arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/rk3399-gru.dtsi:

http://elixir.free-electrons.com/linux/v4.14.2/source/arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/rk3399-gru.dtsi#L705

It has a bridge->port->device nesting hierarchy. I'm not actually sure
where this came from exactly, but I *thought* it was derived from the
standard documentation:

Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pci/pci.txt
PCI Bus Binding to: IEEE Std 1275-1994
http://www.devicetree.org/open-firmware/bindings/pci/pci2_1.pdf

I'm not so sure now...

But device hierarchy can be slightly different than DT hierarchy. In our
case, pcie@0,0 seems to correspond to the port, but has no companion
"device".

Or maybe I'm really off-base.

Sure :)

OK...in that case you've answered your question at the top: "Why is this
a property of the bridge and not of the device itself?" I think Jeffy
answered similarly, but this walked you through how *I* got to that
conclusion, at least.

OK, I guess that's a reasonable conclusion.

The only thing I'm at a loss for is whether this goes in (referring to
rk3399-gru.dtsi) &pcie or &pci_rootport. I think some versions of this
series have been aiming for the former, and some the latter.
