Just to let others know how you fixed it: Above the compose area there
is a small button (or whatever you call it) which can show "Rich Formatting"
or "plain text". Click on that so that it shows "Rich Formatting" all the time.

There are people (including me) who tried various times to get things fixed/
consolidated in cpufreq area. They mostly worked over cleaning up stuff inside
drivers/cpufreq area rather then looking at complete kernel. To make that
path easy, this patchset is the first step: "Bring all of them together"..

After this more consolidation work may follow which will span all
cpufreq drivers.
One aspect would be to use cpufreq-cpu0 for whatever platform we can.

For now, your Ack will work :)
