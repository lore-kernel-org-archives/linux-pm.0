No, that can=92t fit well. But I do not remember who has done this cali=
bration in which situation
because it was done many months ago for the platform data version. We h=

the table for the DT.

Well, it is not =93mine=94, it is the platform_data based driver alread=
y in kernel.org
since ca. 3.12.

We have just updated it to DT to get rid of platform_data in this area =
as well=85

Yes, I see your argument that hiding the tables (two characteristic cur=
ves)
into an analytic approximation can be superior.=20

The problem I see is just that your formula needs some parameters which
are difficult to derive or estimate. And must be adjusted to the specif=
ic
battery and system setup in a non-trivial way.

At least we must supply a tool (in the kernel/scripts directory?) where=
 someone
can can estimate the parameters of the formula from the characteristic =
curves.

Maybe a tool that automatically runs several charge/discharge cycles at
different system load. And measures time vs. voltage. And assumes a lin=
ear
capacity decrease between the end points. (i.e. if it needs 10 hours to=
 charge
from completely empty to full, we can assume 50% after 5,0 hours).

So my goal is to measure all characteristics of the battery - and no ne=
ed to
study a (potentially non-existing) data sheet.

If you can provide that for all parameters of your algorithm I am fine =
with it.

How can you improve your algorithm without tweaking or adding new param=
eters?

Yes, in suspend it needs <20 mA which does not heat or course.
But steady operation at 20-400 mA does significantly rise OMAP
temperature beyond environment temperature.

But you have ugly parameters in dts that nobody can easily see in the s=
chematics
and that are full of assumptions.

=46rom a perspective of uncertainty analysis, estimation of the interna=
l parameters
needs a higher precision than the calibration points.

Well, the biggest tables I have seen in dts are keyboard matrix codes=85

I am not yet convinced that it is better.

It just moves the (unavoidable) limitations (measuring multiple calibra=
tion points)
just to a different area (measuring the hidden and not precisely known =
parameter
of the system).

Ok, I see. Thanks for clarification.
