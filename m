Sure.  And that behavior is documented.  In any case, it's a bug for 
drivers to depend on runtime suspend for carrying out a system suspend.

Perhaps you would like to improve the documentation, to explain this
point more clearly?

That's understandable, since suspend_late is a relatively recent
addition to the runtime PM API.  Naturally, drivers that implemented
runtime PM before suspend_late was added don't use it.

Which drivers do this?  Although this behavior isn't necessarily a bug, 
it probably doesn't do what the driver's author expected.

Again, which drivers?  Perhaps they expect the platform code to put the 
device into a low-power state.

It's okay not to implement .suspend_late.  If .suspend takes care of
everything, .suspend_late won't have work to do.

There's nothing wrong with that (provided there's no risk of a runtime
resume occurring concurrently).  It makes sense to have a check like
that, so that you don't try to put the device into a low-power state
when it already is in low power.

The runtime PM status is generally not reliable after a device's
.suspend has run.  The .resume routine in the bus, class, or driver is
responsible for making sure that the runtime PM status is adjusted to 
the proper value.  This is the intended behavior, and it is documented.

In fact, this example shows that using runtime-PM calls to carry out
system suspend can be a bad idea.  Here's the reason: Runtime suspend
is expected _always_ to enable wakeup (if the hardware supports it).  
But during system suspend, wakeup is supposed to be enabled _only_ if
device_may_wakeup() returns true.  Therefore, using a runtime_suspend
callback to handle system suspend is likely to end up with an incorrect
wakeup setting.
