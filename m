I refuse it because it will be supported by exactly 1 driver in the
kernel - gpio-keys. It is the only driver that allows shut half of the
"device" (because in reality it is a group of disjoint devices). It is
the only case when "muting" a button means that IRQ is shut off abnd
thus CPU can continue to sleep if that button is pressed. For all other
devices that have 1 inettrupt per device, you still have to wake up,
because you don't know whether the button that generated event is
"important" or not.

Now, there is a issue of waking up userspace task, additional scheduling
and keeping CPU running longer than necessary for "uninteresting" keys.
This can be solved by implementing a subscription model which allows
filtering uninteresing events on a per-client basis at evdev level.
This, if implemented properly, would work for _all_ input devices out
there. You were not interested into looking into it (because for your
particular and only device the otehr approach promises bigger savings)
but I think we'll get there eventually.

And the third topic - shutting (or putting into low power) entire device
upon request from userspace. This again has much wider auditory than
gpio-keys, or input devices layer for that matter. We may want to do so
for other types of devices as well. That is why the question when to
general PM list.
