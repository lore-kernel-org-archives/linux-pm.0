It's not difficult.  You just have to decide what situations should 
block opportunistic suspend.  For example, let's say that opportunistic 
suspend should be blocked when your event queue is non-empty.

Then in the routine that adds new events to the queue, while still
holding the spinlock that protects your queue, you enable your suspend
blocker.  Likewise, in the routine that takes events off the queue and
sends them to userspace, while holding the spinlock you test whether
the queue has become empty; if it has you disable your suspend blocker.

That's all.  No other changes are needed (except to create and destroy 
the suspend blocker, of course).  No other interaction with suspend, 
resume, or runtime PM.
