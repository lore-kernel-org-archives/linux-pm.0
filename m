I'll go back to that message, but nothing so far has been flexible enough to
cover everything you can imagine.

The case this and the next patch cover really is to allow drivers that can be
used with or without a PM domain to avoid doing any "are we suspended?" type
of checks in their callbacks.  Actually, the [6/6] is more important from that
standpoint, but this one also may play the role because of the dependencies
between devices involved in the handling of LEAVE_SUSPENDED (eg. say a PCI
parent has a child platform or I2C or similar devices without a PM domain
and what happens to the child affects the parent).

The "or it is allowed to wake up the system from sleep" case may be overly
optimistic, but the remaining two (runtime-suspended devices and devices
that can't generate wakeup signals at all) are quite straightforward to me.

Thanks,
