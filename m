Someday I hope to see this bouncing cow app I keep hearing about.  I
must be pretty spectacular since can't help talking about it.  ;)

I completely agree.  

The only thing being debated is the implementation of the coping
mechanism.

In particular, why the coping mechanism for PM "badness" has to be a
large sledgehammer where other badness (CPU, IO, etc.) has been dealt
with using infrastructure like timers, scheduling, throttling, etc.

My shrink would say that the sledgehammer approach to badness might
work for the short term, but eventually that badness is going to seep
out in other, unpredictable places.

My shrink would also probably tell me that since I'm seem to be the
last one left who seems to care, it's probably time to throw in the
towel.
