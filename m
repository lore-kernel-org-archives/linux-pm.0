Hi,


The patchset merges max77843 regulator driver into max77693.
I am asking for review and acks from multiple subsystems: extcon,
input, mfd, power and regulator.


Changes since v1
================
1. Drop patch "regulator: max77693: Use core code for charger's
   is_enabled" because Mark Brown picked it up.
2. Patch 2: remove some more old IRQ extcon stuff (suggested by Chanwoo
   Choi).
3. Patch 6: minor fixes over defines (suggested by Lee Jones).
4. Send last patch, previously it slipped during "git send-email".
5. Add acks obtained for v1. I still need more of them. :)


Rationale
=========
The recently added max77843 regulator driver is very similar to
its older brother: the max77693. Both devices provide two safeouts
and a charger.

The main difference is in charger's output capabilities and related
registry values.

With some code additions the max77693 regulator driver can support both
chipsets. This reduces overall code duplication and is a first step
toward integrating other drivers for these devices.


Patchset description
====================
Patches 1-2 do various cleanup.
Patch 3 prepares max77694 regulator driver for supporting different
devices.
Patch 4 switches max77693 drivers to common state container.
Patch 5 updates max77843 drivers to common state container.
Patches 6-7 do final cleanup before merging.
Patches 8-9 do the merge of max77843 regulator into max77693.


Dependencies
============
The patchset is rebased on next-20150522. It touches all currently
merged max77843 drivers: extcon, mfd, input and regulator
(charger driver was not yet merged).

Everything is bisectable but next patches depend on previous ones.
So probably the easiest way would be picking picked up by one
maintainer.


Best regards,
Krzysztof
