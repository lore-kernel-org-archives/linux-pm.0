Well, there are two elements to "this sort of thing":

     1. Allow a driver to request that a given clock not be turned off.
     2. Make the cpuidle governors aware of a pending "don't turn off X
        clock source" so they can keep the system in a state where the
        clock doesn't get powered down.

As far as I can tell from the code, neither currently exists at the
moment.
