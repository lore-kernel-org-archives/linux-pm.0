I define "suspend" as

    echo mem > /sys/power/state

I'm not interested in adding another user-space API if it can possibly be
avoided, and I think it can.  But that is a later step in the process.

I think you have acknowledged that there is a race with suspend - thanks.
Next step was "can it be closed".
You seem to suggest that it can, but you describe it as a "work around"
rather than a "bug fix"...

Do you agree that the race is a "bug", and therefore it is appropriate to
"fix" it assuming an acceptable fix can be found (which I think it can)?

If you agree that it is appropriate for try to fix this bug, then the next
step would be to get the Android devs to agree that a fix could - in
principle - address the need for which they created suspend-blockers.
Arve: can you confirm that?

Then, with a clear and agreed goal, we can look at possible fixes.

Thanks,
NeilBrown
