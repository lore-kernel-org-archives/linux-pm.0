IPSOUT and the battery stuff should be revisited once we have
a power supply driver.

These are all unrelated to axp209. You'd end up with

    vin-supply = <&reg_vcc5v>;

for the usb and sata power regulators. You could put these
in sunxi-common-regulators, and override them for boards
that actually have something controllable.
