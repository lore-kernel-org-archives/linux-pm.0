That's not necessary, because the device may be suspended using
pm_runtime_suspend() later than we check pm_runtime_suspended().

I'd use the "runtime only" (or perhaps better "no_dpm") flag as a declaration
(if set) that the device is going to be suspended with the help of "runtime"
callbacks and the driver takes the responsibility for getting things right.

The latter.
