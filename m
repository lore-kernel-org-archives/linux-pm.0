So the concern is validating the properties that get added dynamically and I get
that. How about inserting an overlay for the BT node instead of creating the
node on the fly? Like, drivers/misc/lan966x_pci.dtso

This way, the overlay would be validated against a binding and the driver would
just be inserting it.

I did propose using SW nodes initially, but then it got changed to
OF_DYNAMIC with review from Andy. But honestly, Andy only mentioned 'DT
Overlay' [1], and I was the one decided to use OF_DYNAMIC.
