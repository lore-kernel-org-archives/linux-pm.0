Hi,
The following version 2 of the series arose from trying to use BeagleBo=
ard-XM
(OMAP3 variant) for doing CPU DVFS using cpufreq-cpu0. This series enab=
les the
generic cpufreq-cpu0 driver to be used in device tree enabled boot whil=
e
maintaining support of the legacy omap-cpufreq driver when used in non =
device
tree enabled boot.

However, in order to enable complete SoC entitlement for OMAP platforms=
, with
this series, key features are still pending on device tree adaptation f=
or OMAP:
A) clock framework data transition to DT - this should happen soon, so =
this
series hacks the clock node for the time being as suggested in review o=
f
original series[1].
B) On processors that use voltage controller, voltage processor (VC/VP =
hardware
loop using I2C_SR path) - we have started work on transitioning them to
regulator framework driven by DT.
C) Adaptive Body Bias and SmartReflex AVS conversion to DT.

As a result of these pending features:
- OMAP4 TWL6030 and TPS62361 which set voltage ONLY over I2C_SR have no
regulators associated at the moment - fortunately, we boot at highest v=
oltage,
so things still work.
- Missing ABB and AVS implies that for few of the SoCs (3630, OMAP4), I=
 have
not added those OPPs in DT yet - this also needs alignment with iMX, AM=
 series
pending work, where certain OPPs need enabling based on efuse programme=
d
bit sequences - since it is an add-on work, it is not addressed here.

Note: At this point in time, we do not have DT entries for clock on OMA=
P
platforms. Common Clock Framework(CCF) could also control regulators[2]=
=2E
Once these conversions are complete, there will be minimal cleanup work=
 to
switch to the new data structure changes.

Key benefit of the series is to allow all relevant TI platforms now to =
use a
single cpufreq driver and equivalent frameworks in addition be part of =
the
transition to device tree.
NOTE: As a result of this series:
1. omap-cpufreq will be used only in non device tree boot scenario. we =
should
   delete this driver once the 100% DT conversion is complete.
2. Generic cpufreq-cpu0 will be used only in device tree boot scenario.
boot systems.

Key changes in version 2:
	- series now rebased on Device tree patches queued for OMAP 3.10
	- cpufreq-cpu0 and omap_cpufreq will co-exist and used depending on
	  usage of device tree.
	- minor wording, cleanups for the same.
	- omap3.dtsi and omap4.dtsi now become common dtsi which is used by
	  omap34xx.dtsi, omap36xx.dtsi, omap443x.dtsi, omap4460.dtsi as needed=
