Sure, those 60 can be converted after some work. I just wanted to
understand your plan for these moving forward.

Yes, it would.

First, for example, the amba bus is responsible for the amba bus
clock, but relies on drivers to gate/ungate it during system sleep. In
case the amba drivers don't use the pm_runtime_force_suspend|resume(),
it will explicitly have to start manage the clock during system sleep
themselves. Leading to open coding.

Second, it will introduce a regression in behavior for all users of
pm_runtime_force_suspend|resume(), especially during system resume as
the driver may then end up resuming the device even in case it isn't
needed. I believe I have explained why, also several times by now -
and that's also how far you could take the i2c designware driver at
this point.

That said, I assume the second part may be addressed in this series,
if these drivers convert to use the "driver PM flags", right?

However, what about the first case? Is some open coding needed or your
think the amba driver can instruct the amba bus via the "driver PM
flags"?

Okay, thanks for that clear statement!

I think we have discussed this several times, but the arguments you
have put forward, explaining *why* haven't yet convinced me.

In principle what you have been saying is that it's a "layering
violation" to use pm_runtime_force_suspend|resume() from driver's
system sleep callbacks, but on the other hand you think using
pm_runtime_get*  and friends is okay!?

That makes little sense to me, because it's the same "layering
violation" that is done for both cases.

Moreover, you have been explaining that re-using runtime PM callbacks
for PCI doesn't work. Then my question is, why should a limitation of
the PCI subsystem put constraints on the behavior for all other
subsystems/middle-layers?

That's sounds really great!

This approach concerns me, because if we in the end realizes that
pm_runtime_force_suspend|resume() will be too hard to get rid of, then
this series just add yet another generic way of trying to optimize the
system sleep path for runtime PM enabled devices.

So then we would end up having to support the "direct_complete" path,
the "driver PM flags" and cases where
pm_runtime_force_suspend|resume() is used. No, that just isn't good
enough to me. That will just lead to similar scenarios as we had in
the i2c designware driver.

If we decide to go with these new "driver PM flags", I want to make
sure, as long as possible, that we can remove both the
"direct_complete" path support from the PM core as well as removing
the pm_runtime_force_suspend|resume() helpers.

Of course I am fine with that we postpone doing the actual converting
of drivers etc from this series, although as stated above, let's sure
we *can* do it by using the "driver PM flags".

Kind regards
