Only now I realized that merging this may break the working
orderly_poweroff() out there, because you are defaulting this to 0, no
delay, therefore giving no time for orderly_poweroff() to finish. This
is not good.

I think using 0 delay as immediate power off is not good as we give no
time for graceful shutdown, and by default. My suggestion here
is to use 0 delay as no forced shutdown. Meaning, by default, this
feature is disabled, and all other systems out there, despite DRA7 with
arago over NFS, work as before.

So, please, only schedule if delay is greater than 0.=20

Also I would prefer the config is set to a local variable..
