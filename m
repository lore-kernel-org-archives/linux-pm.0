I'm not sure what you mean exactly, but if you take two PC-like systems
with similar hardware configurations, but different BIOS-es and motherboard
layouts, it's very likely that on one of them PCI PME won't be routed
correctly, for example.  In that case the kernel has no way to figure out
that that system is broken, the problem can only be worked around from user
space by diabling runtime PM on the affected PCI devices.  I expect similar
problems to appear for the PM QoS settings.

No, it's not, but sometimes we simply don't have the choice.  Besides,
in the particular case of PM QoS, the constraints set by user space will
simply be added to the constraints set by kernel subsystems.  Thus they
won't prevent any kernel subsystem from specifying its own constraints,
but they will give user space the option to override the constraints
originating from the kernel.

Do you mean they may rebuild the kernel?  That isn't always possible.

Thanks,
