These are resume callbacks, not suspend callbacks.  Also not all of them
are skipped.  That is quite a bit different from skipping *all* callbacks.

Moreover, at the point the core decides to skip the callbacks, the device
*has* *to* be left suspended and there simply is no point in running them
no matter what.

That part of code can be trivially moved to middle layers, but then each
of them will have to do exactly the same thing.  I don't see any reason to
do that and I'm not finding one in your comments.  Sorry.

It really doesn't work like that.

First, the driver sets the LEAVE_SUSPENDED flag for the core to consume.
The middle layers don't have to look at it at all.

Second, each middle layer sets power.may_skip_resume for devices whose
state after system suspend should match the runtime suspend state.  The
middle layer must know that this is the case to set that bit.  [The core
effectively does that part for devices handled by it directly in patch
[5/6].]

The core then takes the LEAVE_SUSPENDED flags, power.may_skip_resume bits,
status of the children and consumers into account in order to produce the
power.must_resume bits and those are used (later) to decide whether or not
to resume the devices.  That decision is made by the core and so the core
acts on it and the middle layers must follow.

Well, this works the other way around this time, I'm afraid.  At this point
you need to convince me that the approach has real issues. :-)

The doc doesn't describe the design of the code, though.

I guess I'll just add a comment at the point where the status changes.

If all devices have runtime PM disabled, pm_runtime_set_suspended() should
just do what it is asked for unless called with an invalid argument or
similar.

At that point it has not been decided whether or not the devices will stay
suspended yet.  The status cannot be changed before making that decision,
which only happens in the noirq resume phase.
