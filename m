If you're interested in the history, I did some digging last year:

Note that the new code always has a dev_pm_domain, while the old code had it
conditionally on CONFIG_PM.

I don't think that matters much, as we seem to be having more and more
systems that rely on CONFIG_PM=y...

Looks good to me, and works fine on (pre-Clock Domain) r8a7791/koelsch
and r8a7740/armadillo-legacy (with PM Domains, but still relying on the
drivers/sh/pm_runtime.c hack for devices in the C5 "always on" domain).

This code is no longer used in multiplatform kernels on shmobile boards
with real PM Domains.
