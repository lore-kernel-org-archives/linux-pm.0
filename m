Yes, I have no problem with "2".

I believe it is more important to get it right than to have a solution
right now. x86-64 should be best architecture to start...

I don't understand kaslr, but it looks to me like you need to store
the kaslr seed in the hibernation image, then use thet in
set_up_temporary_mappings(). It should not be that bad.
