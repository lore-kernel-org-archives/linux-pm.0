That is one way to use it, and I did this so code that opened an input
device without reading from it would not prevent suspend forever. In
the last patchset I posted, I instead used an ioctl to enable the
suspend blocker.

For incoming network traffic we use a wakelock with a timeout to
prevent suspend long enough for the data to make it to user-space
since we have not added wakelocks to the network stack.

We did this to avoid changing to the network stack, tty layer, etc.

Keypad, network, charger, rtc, but I'm sure I forgot some.

In addition to the drivers that enable the wakeup events, we have
added suspend blockers to the input event code and power supply
framework. The tty layer and network stack would also need suspend
blockers to avoid using timeouts.
