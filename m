What happens if the variable is completed while nobody is waiting for
it?  The next time somebody tries to wait, won't the wait terminate
immediately?

Of course.  That's how processes that are blocked in the kernel are
given a chance to enter the freezer.

It should not think that.  There are other reasons why an ioctl might
return early, such as a genuine signal or two status changes occurring
before the ioctl starts (the next two ioctls will both return
immediately, but the first one will contain the final status and the
second won't contain any status change).

For this to work correctly, the kernel should accumulate a bitmap of
status changes as they occur.  When an ioctl returns, it should provide
the bitmap of all the status changes that have occurred since the last
ioctl (and it should clear the status-change bitmap) along with the
current status.  Otherwise the application has no way to know about
changes that occur between ioctl calls.

What's wrong with that?  It should be smart enough to realize that most
of these events aren't actual status changes.

Yes: The freezer.

Yes, in theory.  In practice it's not a good idea, since the call 
wouldn't be able to distinguish between an actual signal and the onset 
of a suspend.  You might end up with a call that ignores all signals 
and hence cannot be interrupted.

It's not clear that anything needs to be fixed, except possibly the
application.  Hint: See the SA_RESTART flag for sigaction(2).

It also sounds like the application's design may be fundamentally
broken.  Certain kinds of defects cannot be worked around in the
kernel.
