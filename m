I only have a Mac and Macs don't use ACPI-based hotplug, only native
pciehp hotplug. So unfortunately I can't say anything about whether
the ACPI patch is still needed. For Dave Airlie's use case the patch
seems not to be needed, he wants to suspend root ports to which a GPU
is attached, so I guess he doesn't care much about hotplug. The patch
could therefore be pulled by Linus separately, if it turns that it's
still needed.

Thanks,

Lukas
