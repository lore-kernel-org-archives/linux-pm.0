You could try changing this to pm_runtime_put_sync_suspend().  But
putting pm_runtime_dont_use_autosuspend() before the put_sync seems
like a perfectly reasonable thing to do, especially if you feel you
should reverse all the changes you made at the start.

The reinit function gets called too late to do what you want -- namely, 
put the hardware in a low-power state.

That _is_ what you want, isn't it?  The alternative is to leave
dev->power.rpm_status set to RPM_ACTIVE, to match the hardware's actual 
state.

Given that the reinit function is supposed to restore the initial 
settings, it probably ought to call pm_runtime_dont_use_autosuspend().  
But that won't be enough to fix your problem.

Your understanding is slightly wrong.  pm_runtime_put_sync() _does_
work -- that is, it does what it's supposed to do.  The difficulty is
that what it's supposed to do doesn't match what you think.

pm_runtime_put_sync() is supposed to follow the driver's wishes.  It
invokes the driver's runtime_idle callback if there is one, and the
callback routine can start a suspend or an autosuspend.  If there is no
callback, it will use whatever autosuspend setting the driver has set
up.  If you want to override the autosuspend setting, use
pm_runtime_put_sync_suspend() instead.
