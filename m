Thanks I tried that, but that's not it.

Tturns out just adding back .read = twl4030_read fixes it..
I added a dummy function for read and am now seeing a bunch
of reads that now don't happen:

(twl4030_dummy_read [snd_soc_twl4030]) from [<bf1cc3b4>]
  (snd_soc_codec_drv_read+0x1c/0x28 [snd_soc_core])
(snd_soc_codec_drv_read [snd_soc_core]) from [<bf1da1cc>]
  (snd_soc_dapm_new_widgets+0x29c/0x578 [snd_soc_core])
(snd_soc_dapm_new_widgets [snd_soc_core]) from [<bf1d2f30>]
  (snd_soc_register_card+0xad0/0xe30 [snd_soc_core])
(snd_soc_register_card [snd_soc_core]) from [<bf1e1850>]
  (devm_snd_soc_register_card+0x30/0x70 [snd_soc_core])
(devm_snd_soc_register_card [snd_soc_core]) from [<bf234364>]
  (omap_twl4030_probe+0x100/0x1d0 [snd_soc_omap_twl4030])
(omap_twl4030_probe [snd_soc_omap_twl4030]) from [<c0606660>]
  (platform_drv_probe+0x50/0xb0)

So probably there are other asoc drivers broken too with these
kind of patches until snd_soc_codec_drv_write() and
snd_soc_codec_drv_read() are fixed?

Tony
