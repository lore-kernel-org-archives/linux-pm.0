OK if these interrupts meet that criteria to use IRQF_NO_SUSPEND, then
it should be fine, my earlier argument was based on the assumption that
it's just another wakeup interrupt.

If it's already take care, then fine. I am just hunting all the misuse
of IRQF_NO_SUSPEND flag especially as wakeup source and fixing them

OK, understood now. Thanks
