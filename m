Yeah. And I personally agree with you there. But this is a policy
decision that should not prevent android from doing it differently.
The kernel can not win if it does not try to integrate any use of it.
After all, we are a free comunity and if someone wants to use it their
way, why not allow for it? (As long as it does not directly impact other
uses)

The best solution wins, but not by decision of some kernel
development gatekeepers, but because it is superior. There are no clear
markings of the better solution. Time will tell.

Cheers,
