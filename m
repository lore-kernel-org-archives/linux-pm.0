I had applied this to my for-linus branch, headed for v3.7, but had to
drop it because it introduced these warnings:

drivers/acpi/pci_bind.c: In function 'acpi_pci_unbind':
drivers/acpi/pci_bind.c:48:2: warning: passing argument 1 of
'acpi_power_resource_unregister_device' from incompatible pointer type
[enabled by default]
include/acpi/acpi_bus.h:346:6: note: expected 'struct device *' but
argument is of type 'struct pci_dev *'
drivers/acpi/pci_bind.c: In function 'acpi_pci_bind':
drivers/acpi/pci_bind.c:75:2: warning: passing argument 1 of
'acpi_power_resource_register_device' from incompatible pointer type
[enabled by default]
include/acpi/acpi_bus.h:345:5: note: expected 'struct device *' but
argument is of type 'struct pci_dev *'

Apparently this wasn't tested :-(
