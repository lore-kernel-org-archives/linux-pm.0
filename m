I tried to simulate the issue.

In the probe function of drivers/thermal/ti-soc-thermal/ti-bandgap.c
ti_bandgap_probe i call

orderly_poweroff(true);

This is while driver probes are still on going. I observe that
ret = run_cmd(poweroff_cmd);

ret is a non-zero value and we enter the if condition:

Even after the

emergency_sync();
kernel_power_off();

calls

the console remained active in weird state.
