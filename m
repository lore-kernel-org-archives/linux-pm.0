This is not a patch, but rather a question regarding the deferred
probe's effect on PCIe PM ordering. This happens on our system
which defer the probing of root bridge due to  the IOMMU not being
ready. Because of the deferred action, the bridge is moved to the
end of the dpm_list which results in incorrect suspend and resume
sequence.

In the cases I have seen, the bridge is always reordered because of
startup sequence. They are always place after the endpoint. If that
is the case the following code should be able to prevent such cases.
However, is there some cases here that would violate such situation?
