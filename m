I see.

PCIe ports don't do PM - yet.  Mika has posted a series of patches to implement
that, however, that are waiting for comments now:

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/8453311/
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/8453381/
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/8453391/

Using pci_set_power_state() would be more appropriate IMO, but you can get
to the bridge via dev->parent too, can't you?

In any case, it looks like you and Mika need to talk. :-)

PCIe ports are power-managend by (newer) Windows AFAICS, but we know for a fact
that this simply doesn't work reliably on some older hardware which is why
we don't do that.  I suppose that the Windows in question uses a cut-off date
or similar to decide what do do with PCIe ports PM.

Thanks,
