I think you're right, but I'm not sure yet.

In my opinion the _irq operations should really be one-shot, without
any looping, waking up parents etc.  I mean, if the parent is not RPM_ACTIVE,
the _irq resume should immediately fail and analogously for the _irq
suspend.  And so on.  As simple as reasonably possible.

Yes, see above.  I think printing a message in case a suspended parent
prevented an _irq resume from happening, for example, is a good idea.

OK

Well, calling _idle is like saying "I think this device may be idle, please
consider suspending it", while calling _suspend is like saying "suspend
this device unless you can't".  I think that's enough of a difference to
have separate _idle.

A subsystem or a driver may want to schedule the suspend with a timeout
if _idle is called instead of just suspending synchronously.  The r8169 driver
actually does something similar (although a bit more complicated).

OK, I'm fine with removing it or calling rpm_idle(dev, RPM_ASYNC)
instead of rpm_idle(dev, 0) in there.
