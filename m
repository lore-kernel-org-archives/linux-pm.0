It did fix a problem making sure the regulator's shutdown is invoked after the
mmc shutdown. And reverting 52cdbdd49853 reintroduces the problem.

I tried adding device_link_add in the _regulator_get, something like below and
it seems to fix the problem again. But I guess we have to maintain a list of
device_link's in regulator_dev since there can be many consumers for a single
regulator and we also have to invoke device_link_del in _regulator_put. In
general this might have to be extended to other producers like PHY, pinctrl etc..

If this looks okay, I can post a patch after adding a list and invoking
device_link_del() in regulator core.
