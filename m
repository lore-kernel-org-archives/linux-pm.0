Except, we're not talking "wakelock" ... :)

So ... no, these cases still have no solution.
(I think  that's at least five years now.)

Exactly why they make good examples  for
turning up framework limitations... like
having overlooked constraints coming from
various SoC peripherals.

Requiring "CPU governors" to be involved in such
stuff feels a bit off-course to me.  At least, if
the involvement is very deep. The constraints are
from the integrated peripherals, not (usually)
from the CPU

There are plent of places to hang SoC or
device specific data, once there's awareness
that without such data, (which PCs hide behind
ACPI bytecode) the PM framework is missing out
on support for some desirable low power modes.

I don't quite see that.  The drivers get called
in enough places, and they'll know if the system
is going to be in a suspend state where they need
to be partially =

aactive (with various QOS constraints, or they
can't work.

If it wakes via hotplug, then the driver must
already Do The Right Thing; what input would
be needed  (Beyond changing the cable config)?
