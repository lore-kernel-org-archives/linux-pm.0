I've been testing the same hardware but unfortunately wasn't able to see th=
e=20
issue back again. One thing to notice is that the laptop has 4 USB ports ou=
t=20
of which 3 are 1.1 and only 1 is 2.0.
The suspected faulty USB HDD Enclosure has 2 cables that I was connecting t=
o,=20
thus ending up connecting them to a 2.0 and 1.1 USB port.

I tried with just 1 port connected to USB 2.0 port and haven't been able to=
=20
reproduce the issue back again yet. :-(
I also wasn't able to reproduce back the old issue with the pattern I=20
mentioned in the previous post (1 cable connected to 1.1 and the other=20
connected to 2.0 port)

I'll keep testing and post to this thread if I find something useful.

Thanks,
Ritesh
