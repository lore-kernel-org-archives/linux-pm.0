Hi,

I understand that, but still we should be telling developers what
they're doing wrong so that they can improve themselves as professionals
and still make the final device better.

I see. Just hope MeeGo doesn't venture on the same waters :-s

but can anyone write an app that holds a suspend_blocker ?? If so, then
your goal is already broken, right ? I mean, if anyone can keep a
suspend_blocker held forever, you'll never ever sleep, right ? While
with runtime, if you keep the keypad open, only the keypad and the paths
directly related to it (probably the i2c controller and the power domain
where the i2c controller sits) will be kept alive, no ?

I just tend to agree with Kevin on questioning how different how
different this actually is from runtime_pm. I guess I would need to dig
through some documentation in order to understand but it seems really
similar.
