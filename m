I can accept that definition, but this is not what "opportunistic" means in the
Arve's changelogs.  What it means there is that he wants the system to suspend
even when it is not technically idle (like in the updatedb example I gave in a
previous message).  Suspend blockers are supposed to be a mechanism by which
the kernel and user space together may determine when to suspend (and it's
somewhat orthogonal to idle).

Thanks,
