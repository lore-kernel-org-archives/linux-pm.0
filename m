Subject: [PATCH] usb: gadget: move gadget API functions to udc-core

instead of defining all functions as static inlines,
let's move them to udc-core and export them with
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL, that way we can make sure that
only GPL drivers will use them.

As a side effect, it'll be nicer to add tracepoints
to the gadget API.

While at that, also fix Kconfig dependencies to
avoid randconfig build failures.

+ * in some cases.)  When control responses are deferred (the response is
+ * written after the setup callback returns), then usb_ep_set_halt() may be
+ * used on ep0 to trigger protocol stalls.  Depending on the controller,

=2D *
=2D * Each request is turned into one or more packets.  The controller driv=

ed
=2D * automatically.  The last packet will be short if the request doesn't =
fill it
=2D * out completely.  Zero length packets (ZLPs) should be avoided in port=
able
=2D * protocols since not all usb hardware can successfully handle zero len=
gth
=2D * packets.  (ZLPs may be explicitly written, and may be implicitly writ=
ten if
=2D * the request 'zero' flag is set.)  Bulk endpoints may also be used
=2D * for interrupt transfers; but the reverse is not true, and some endpoi=
nts
=2D * won't support every interrupt transfer.  (Such as 768 byte packets.)
=2D *
=2D * Interrupt-only endpoints are less functional than bulk endpoints, for
=2D * example by not supporting queueing or not handling buffers that are
=2D * larger than the endpoint's maxpacket size.  They may also treat data
=2D * toggle differently.
=2D *
=2D * Control endpoints ... after getting a setup() callback, the driver qu=
eues
=2D * one response (even if it would be zero length).  That enables the

=2D * functions may return negative error codes to generate protocol stalls.
=2D * (Note that some USB device controllers disallow protocol stall respon=
ses
