Hi Linus,

Please pull from

 git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rafael/linux-pm.git \
 pm+acpi-4.2-rc3

to receive power management and ACPI fixes for v4.2-rc3 with
top-most commit 17ffc8b083ac299ff798419d1887b7cdcd4ae4d2

 Merge branches 'pm-cpuidle', 'pm-cpufreq' and 'acpi-resources'

on top of commit bc0195aad0daa2ad5b0d76cce22b167bc3435590

 Linux 4.2-rc2

These fix two bugs in the cpufreq core (including one recent
regression), fix a 4.0 PCI regression related to the ACPI resources
management and quieten an RCU-related lockdep complaint about a
tracepoint in the suspend-to-idle code.

Specifics:

 - Fix a recently introduced issue in the cpufreq policy object
   reinitialization that leads to CPU offline/online breakage
   (Viresh Kumar).

 - Make it possible to access frequency tables of offline CPUs
   which is needed by thermal management code among other things
   (Viresh Kumar).

 - Fix an ACPI resource management regression introduced during
   the 4.0 cycle that may cause incorrect resource validation
   results to appear in 32-bit x86 kernels due to silent truncation
   of 64-bit values to 32-bit (Jiang Liu).

 - Fix up an RCU-related lockdep complaint about suspicious RCU
   usage in idle caused by using a suspend tracepoint in the
   core suspend-to-idle code (Rafael J Wysocki).

Thanks!
