Hi Thomas,

That is the whole point! This code needs a serious clean-up and reorganizat=
ion.
The patch I submitted is now merged in the tip tree, but the can be
corrected once the new power trace API is agreed on.

There is no clear link between the POWER_ types enum and the API, that
needs to change.

Agree. We need some better definitions for the events and at the same
time a more flexible way to pass extra arguments (e.g. like a return
code or the real HW state in case the desired state is not reached).
Also it is required to be able to track sub-states.
The idea is to identify the C-states latency in the low power entry
and exit paths, using 2 new macros in the enum and a sub state
argument. Cf. http://omappedia.org/images/b/b9/Pytimechart_screenshot9_rs.j=
pg
(from http://omappedia.org/wiki/Power_Management_Debug_and_Profiling).

That was a hack, it is now gone. The new power_end only takes the
cpu_id argument.

No. We need something like Documentation/trace/events-kmem.txt. I can
write that with for the new power API.

Most of the events can be converted to power_switch, but not all.
Example: you need to know when the suspend ends.

Agree on that. As said above I would like to have extra args.

BTW I can patch pytimechart. What other tools have to change? powertop ...?

OK

> How do you track when the S-states end?
Two options: 1) have new arguments that indicates enter/exit and a
sub-state; 2) a new event fot the exit.
I am in favor of 1 which is more generic.

Ok thanks for those remarks and suggetions.
Let me come back soon with a new power API proposal.
