That's not true, not even for omap.

There are definitely devices which HW state is reflected by RPM_ACTIVE
at boot. It's the responsible of the subsystem/driver (including PM
domains) to make sure the runtime PM status is updated accordingly, to
reflect the real HW state.

For omap hwmod, at device registration in omap_device_build_from_dt()
it may actually invoke pm_runtime_set_active() if the device is
enabled. To my understanding, that's done to synchronize the real HW
state with the runtime PM status, right?

I don't see the problem, but of course you know omap for better than I do.

So if you are concerned about this, perhaps adding a dev_dbg print
when the omap hwmod's ->runtime_suspend() callback returns zero could
be a way forward?

Okay, thanks for testing!

Kind regards
