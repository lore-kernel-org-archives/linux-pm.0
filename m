ISTR that DaVinci is similar ... but much simpler, with fewer
power domains and more are "always on".  Not much of the DaVinci
support is upstream yet though.

I'm not sure how many non-TI parts will need similar software
support.  It's my understanding that not many vendors put
that much energy into support for leakage current management.

(Here, a key observation is that when a section of a chip has
gated all its clocks off, that leaves leakage current as the
top source of power wastage.  Cooperative drivers could then
let that section be powered down to eliminate leakage.  So the
first level of power management is clock gating, at least in
part with software support.  The power domain gating is a
second level.)


The "regulator" stuff is not unrelated ... except that this
power domain stuff *only* needs on/off switches (like almost all
power domains I've ever used), is tightly coupled to clocks,
and unlike "regulators" is more oriented towards SOC-internal
concerns than board-level ones.

My two cents:  merge the OMAP stuff first, then see what kinds
of generalization would be needed before other chips could use it.

Nobody wins by holding this back ... but everyone on OMAP2/OMAP3
loses.
