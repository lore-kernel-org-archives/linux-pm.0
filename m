The primary client for opportunistic suspend and suspend blockers
appears to be embedded systems.  These systems are typically capable of
powering the CPU down and up again with low latency, and they typically
have very aggressive runtime PM support capable of powering down each
device when it's not in active use.  Given this ability, it does seem
that opportunistic suspend and suspend blockers might be unnecessary.

I'd like to explore this avenue a little farther.  In particular, what =

is the issue involving loss of wakeup events?  Can you describe this in =

more detail?

Why would you want to use system suspend if runtime PM can do
everything you need?

Sure, I can see that an ACPI-based system needs something more.  But =

that's not the real issue here.
