I tried now on my Lenovo Yoga 900 laptop and unfortunately "PCI: Power
on bridges before scanning new devices" seems not to be enough. This
machine has SD-card reader connected to one PCIe port and once I unload
the sdhci-pci driver and enable runtime PM for the device, next system
suspend/resume cycle loses the SD-card reader PCI device.

I will investigate more tomorrow -- it is getting late here.

Anyway, maybe it is safer to postpone this series for v4.8 to give it
more testing time in -next.
