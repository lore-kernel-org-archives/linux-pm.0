I don't follow.  Suppose an asset is attached to ehci-omap.0 with its
string set to "-0:1.0/port1" and the other members pointing to the
regulator, clock and so on.  And suppose the USB port code, when
creating a new port, checks for a name match against all the assets
attached to its bus's host controller device structure.  That should
do exactly what you want while using only one asset.

Not quite.  If you do it generally then you have to insert hooks at all 
the places where a subsystem _might_ need it.  If you do it 
specifically then no hooks are needed at all -- just a match call at 
the right place in the subsystem that needs it.

Assuming DT can be extended to support assets, adding one asset will be 
simpler than adding two.

Also it isn't type-safe, although that's probably not a big concern.

I agree, assets look like a good way to improve this.  In fact, to some
extent assets appear to be a generalization or extension of platform
data.
