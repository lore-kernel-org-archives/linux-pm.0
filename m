Hi,

Here's few more cpcap charger fixes based on newly discovered
documentation for similar hardware for NXP MC13783 PMIC in
MC13783UG.pdf. And with the ADC and charger values now making
sense, let's fix the charge voltage table too based on the ADC
values.

This set depends on the "[PATCH 0/4] Few cpcap charger fixes for
v4.12-rc cycle" set of patches.

Regards,

Tony
