Not quite! On the other end of that SPI link is our power
regulators. (I'm not making this up, they are really there.) The events
in the queue may be the register writes that actually put the system
to low-power sleep.

But the apropriate action may likely be to wait for this queue to become
empty before returning 0 from suspend().
