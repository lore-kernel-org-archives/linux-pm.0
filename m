Right, but that doesn't automatically make it necessary to use runtime PM
callbacks in the middle layer.  Its system-wide PM callbacks may be
suitable for that just fine.

That is, at least in some cases, you can combine ->runtime_suspend from a
driver and ->suspend_late from a middle layer with no problems, for example.

That's why some middle layers allow drivers to point ->suspend_late and
->runtime_suspend to the same routine if they want to reuse that code.

But (a) it doesn't have to follow it and (b) in some cases it should not
follow it.

Which, again, doesn't mean that runtime PM callbacks from the middle layer
have to be used for that.

Which pretty much defeats the purpose of the wrappers, doesn't it?

And because the parent remains in runtime suspend late enough in the
system suspend path, its children also are guaranteed to be suspended.

But then all of them need to be left in runtime suspend during system
resume too, which is somewhat restrictive, because some drivers may
want their devices to be resumed then.

[BTW, our current documentation recommends resuming devices during
system resume, actually, and gives a list of reasons why. :-)]

Indeed.
