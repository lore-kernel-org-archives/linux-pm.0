Then maybe split this out in a separate patch? Do the trivial linear
bucket thing first and then do this smarty pants thing on top.

One problem with the scheme is that it doesn't defrag; so if you get a
peak usage, you can still end up with only two active buckets in
different lines.

Also; if it is it's own patch, you get a much better view of the
additional complexity and a chance to justify it ;-)

Also; would it make sense to do s/cpu/rq/ on much of this? All this
uclamp_cpu_*() stuff really is per rq and takes rq arguments, so why
does it have cpu in the name... no strong feelings, just noticed it and
thought is a tad inconsistent.
