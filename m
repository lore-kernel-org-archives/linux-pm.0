Why not?  Consider this: Is there any reason to support inhibit when
CONFIG_PM is disabled?  I can't come up with any.

Well, if "inhibit" is a PM attribute then the callback should be a PM 
callback.  :-)

I don't follow your reasoning.

The hard part is to come up with a design that Greg agrees with.  If 
the design is okay, there's no reason not to accept the patch.

One of the questions amounts to this: Do we want to allow situations
where input is inhibited but the user prevents the device from going
into runtime suspend by setting power/control = "on"?  If the answer is
Yes then "inhibit" should be a separate attribute.  Otherwise, we can 
just let "inhibit" be another setting in power/control.

Another question is: Do we want to make it easy for drivers to support
inhibit while still incrementing their PM usage counter every time the
device file is opened?  If we do then inhibit must be considered
separate from runtime suspend, because a device _can't_ go directly
into runtime suspend when the usage counter is > 1.  If we don't then 
we will most likely have to change the runtime-PM support in some 
drivers before they can implement inhibit.
