If I understand correctly, that means you allow the Thunderbolt
controller to go into runtime suspend only when nothing is plugged into
any of the ports.  Is that right?  It's quite inefficient.

What I'm getting at is that we should have proper runtime-PM support
for bridges, i.e., I agree with what you wrote above.  A bridge can
safely go into runtime suspend when there are no unsuspended devices
attached to any of its downstream ports.  (That's how the USB hub
driver works, for instance.)  Doing things that way would make
everything simpler in the long run.

So my suggestion is that you change over to the "less kludgy solution"  
and work on that instead.
