What is the connection here?  013c074f8642 causes device_attach() to
return -EPROBE_DEFER, and your patch makes pci_bus_add_device() treat
that as success, so it continues on and sets dev->is_added.

Since we will now set dev->is_added even for -EPROBE_DEFER, why do we
need to change the "BUG_ON(!dev->is_added)" in pci_bus_add_devices()?

I agree that device_attach() might fail for reasons other than
-EPROBE_DEFER, and it might be nice to avoid the BUG_ON then.  It just
seems like those scenarios are different from the -EPROBE_DEFER one.

Sorry I'm being so dense here.  I'm not very familiar with
suspend/resume, so I'm having a hard time following everything.

You're right; sorry, I just wasn't reading your code clearly.  I don't
think we need an extra message.  We should already have messages for
detecting the new device and its BARs, and those should be enough.
