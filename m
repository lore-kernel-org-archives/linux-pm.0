SDIO reset is only needed if the card has not been power-cycled.  The
assumption is that the platform takes care of that when needed. e.g. when
rebooting instead of going to S4.

The wifi driver expects to find the function in an initialized state.
Otherwise it would have to re-enable the function and re-do the
function-specific initialization.  I don't know if there are other
consequences.  Presumably it will have lost any information about the nature
of the wake-up trigger.
