Sorry no idea about that :) I though you may have some ideas based on
dealing with the driver.

It seems maps is the only one then, assuming the cpacity-uah can be mad=

No no, "capacity-uah" is what we should use, but you need an ack from
the battery and device tree people that this is OK. Let's not add
"ti,capacity-uah=E2=80=9D as that can obviously be a generic property.

Oh if they are battery spicific, then ideally we'd have generic batery
voltage to capacity maps property rather than a custom ti specific
property.

To avoid extra hassles later on, maybe you could submit a generic
binding patch only documenting it to the battery people and the device
tree people? That will make it easier to maintain this driver in the
long run.
