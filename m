This patch removes out of the TODO list those already completed.

Here is the status and why they are removed:
 on ti-bandgap.c:
-- Add support to hwmon: REMOVED, no need to have hwmon interfaces
as the control is done via thermal framework.
-- Test every exposed API to userland: DONE, via thermal fw APIs
By now, no specific API is exposed by this driver
-- Revisit data structures and simplify them: DONE, all
unused fields are flagged for future removal.
-- Once SCM-core api settles, update this driver accordingly: DONE,
the BG driver can exist without SCM driver by ioremapping its own
registers and doing its own locking.

 on ti-thermal-common.c/ti-thermal.h:
-- Revisit trips and its definitions: DONE, for now there is no
need to change current definition. Alert based policy will be add
in future.
-- Revisit trending: DONE, OMAP5 history buffer support has been
implemented. Devices without history buffer will use thermal fw
trending capability.

on omap5-thermal.c
-- Add support for GPU cooling: REMOVED: this will not be part
of this driver. Must be done in a separated cooling device.

 generally:
-- make checkpatch.pl and sparse happy: DONE, sparse remaining
warning is not an issue.
-- update documentation: DONE, kernel-doc for ti-bandgap is now
available.
