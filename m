To be precise, it is not quite possible to figure out which WAKE#
triggered, if they are sharing the line, without looking into the
config spaces of the devices below the switch.  The switch is not
expected to do that AFAICS.  It only generates a PME message meaning
"wakeup is being signaled somewhere below" and the PME driver that
handles the Root Port receiving it should look at the PME Status bits
of the devices below the switch (the pme.c driver does that IIRC or at
least it should do that ;-)).

Still, the handling of WAKE# doesn't need to cover this case AFAICS.

Thanks,
Rafael
