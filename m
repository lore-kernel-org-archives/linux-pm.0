I have changed the muxing for the card detect signal to get it on a gpio
instead of the card detect pio (peripheral io) of the controller. I thought
it can work because we have a 'force card detect' bit. Unfortunately, it is
resetted when we perform a software reset. Moreover I need to keep the
card detect pio, because it used to perform fast startup from ultra low power
modes.

Maybe it could work by using an extra pin but it invovles to do hardawre
changes on the boards and needing two pins for one signal is not acceptable.

I'll do more tests to use runtime pm without polling for card detection
and without using sdhci_runtime_suspend_host().
