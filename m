This property is optional, there is a default value in pwrseq driver.

My current solution like below, but it seems you didn't agree with that.
I just double confirm here, if you don't, I give up the solution for
using generic power sequence framework.

In drivers/usb/core/hub.c

	for_each_child_of_node(parent->of_node, node) {
		hdev_pwrseq = pwrseq_alloc(node, "usb_pwrseq_generic");
		if (!IS_ERR_OR_NULL(hdev_pwrseq)) {
			pwrseq_node = kzalloc(sizeof(pwrseq_node), GFP_KERNEL);
			if (!pwrseq_node) {
				ret = -ENOMEM;
				goto err1;
			}
			/* power on sequence */
			ret = pwrseq_pre_power_on(hdev_pwrseq);
			if (ret)
				goto err2;

			pwrseq_node->pwrseq_on = hdev_pwrseq;
			list_add(&pwrseq_node->list, &hub->pwrseq_list);
		} else if (IS_ERR(hdev_pwrseq)) {
			return PTR_ERR(hdev_pwrseq);
		}
	}

In drivers/power/pwrseq/core.c

struct pwrseq *pwrseq_alloc(struct device_node *np, const char *dev_name)
{
	struct pwrseq *p, *pwrseq = NULL;
	bool created;

	/* If there is no device is associated with this node, create it */
	if (!of_find_device_by_node(np)) {
		if (of_platform_device_create(np, dev_name, NULL))
			created = true;
		else
			return ERR_PTR(-ENODEV);
	}

	mutex_lock(&pwrseq_list_mutex);
	list_for_each_entry(p, &pwrseq_list, pwrseq_node) {
		if (p->dev->of_node == np) {
			if (!try_module_get(p->owner))
				dev_err(p->dev,
					"increasing module refcount failed\n");
			else
				pwrseq = p;
			break;
		}
	}

And there is a platform driver at drivers/power/pwrseq/pwrseq_usb_generic.c
to handle these pwrseq properties, see my patch 9/12.

How the driver know what it needs to handle (eg, gpio, clock) if there
is no device for it? The most important we need to consider is which
device owns there power sequence properties, then the corresponding
driver can handle it.
