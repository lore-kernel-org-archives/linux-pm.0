Well, I agree that keeping battery at 4.2V constant voltage mode is
bad, but I'd not call it overcharge. If someone can fix the comment,
that would be nice.

Yes... I guess that makes sense for you, but I wonder if we should be
doing this by default. It seems a lot of cheap chargers can be easily
destroyed if you overload them.
