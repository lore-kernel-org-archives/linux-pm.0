No idea. :-)

Correct. device_may_wakeup() is defined in include/linux/pm_wakeup.h as:
dev->power.can_wakeup && !!dev->power.wakeup

The first one, dev->power.can_wakeup is true because PME is claimed to be
supported for all power states in the PMC register, so pci_pm_init() calls
device_set_wakeup_capable(&dev->dev, true):
  Capabilities: [80] Power Management version 3
    Flags: PMEClk- DSI- D1+ D2+ AuxCurrent=0mA PME(D0+,D1+,D2+,D3hot+,D3cold+)
    Status: D0 NoSoftRst+ PME-Enable- DSel=0 DScale=1 PME-

The second one, dev->power.wakeup is false because device_wakeup_enable()
is never called.

Fear of breaking things. It would mean that a device would be left in
D3cold even though it may not be able to signal wakeup from that power
state. That's a change of behaviour the consequences of which I cannot
estimate. Intuitively, I would expect breakage from such a change.

Thanks,
