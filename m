I want it to be generic, though, so setting it should not be treated as a
mistake in any case (for example, because some drivers interact with the
ACPI PM domain and with some other middle layers).

If SMART_PREPARE simply overlaps with your defaul behavior, there's no need
to check the flag, but then it can be set really safely. :-)

You are right, I just should not use the _generic_prepare() thing there.

I'll send a fix patch for that.

Right.
