So what happens if you task is CPU bound and gets suspended and is
holding a resource (lock, whatever) that is required by someone else
that didn't get suspended?

That's the classic inversion problem, and is caused by not running
runnable tasks.

Why would be care about external events? Clearly these apps are ill
behaved, otherwise they would have listened to the environment telling
them to idle.

Why would you try to let buggy apps work as intended instead of break
them as hard as possible? Such policy promotes crappy code since people
get away with it.

Clearly I mean TASK_RUNNABLE, if not that the scheduler doesn't care.

Sure, that same main loop will probably receive a message along the
lines of, 'hey, screen is off, we ought to go sleep'. If after that it
doesn't listen, and more serious messages don't get responded to, simply
kill the thing.

Again, there is no reason what so ever to tolerate broken apps, it only
promotes crappy apps.
