Yes, it is related to runtime PM.  In the PCI subsystem, runtime PM 
doesn't do anything unless pci_dev->driver is set.  You can see this at 
the start of pci_pm_runtime_suspend().

Since we want the driver's probe routine to be able to carry out
runtime PM operations, we have to set pci_dev->driver before the probe
routine runs.
