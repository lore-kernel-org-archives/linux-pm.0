The following series arose from trying to use BeagleBoard-XM (OMAP3 var=
iant)
for doing CPU DVFS using cpufreq-cpu0. This series will eventually resu=
lt in
migrating the cpufreq support only through device tree (part of the eff=
ort
to migrate away from non-DT configurations for OMAP). Unfortunately, as=
 already
known, we have a bunch of legacy code and mutually dependent device tre=
e
conversion that is pending.
Key features pending:
A) clock framework transition to DT - this should happen soon, so this =
series hacks
the clock node for the time being as suggested in review of original se=
ries
B) on processors that use voltage controller, voltage processor (VC/VP =
hardware
loop using I2C_SR path) - we have started work on transitioning them to=
 regulator
framework driven by DT.
C) Adaptive Body Bias and SmartReflex AVS conversion to DT.

As a result of these pending features:
- OMAP4 TWL6030 and TPS62361 which set voltage ONLY over I2C_SR have no=
 regulators
associated at the moment - fortunately, we boot at highest voltage, so =
things still
work.
- Missing ABB and AVS implies that for few of the SoCs (3630, OMAP4), I=
 have not added
those OPPs in DT yet - this also needs alignment with iMX, AM series li=
ke pending work,
where certain OPPs need enabling based on efuse programmed bit sequence=
s - since it
is an add-on work, it is not addressed here.

Note: Somewhere in the future, when we have regulators driven off CCF a=
nd OMAP
converted to CCF, we could remove the DT regulator requirements there a=
s well.

Key benefit of the series is to allow all relevant TI platforms now to =
use a single
cpufreq driver and equivalent frameworks in addition be part of the tra=
nsition to
DT. As a result of this series, CPUFreq feature will not be available f=
or non-DT
boot systems.
