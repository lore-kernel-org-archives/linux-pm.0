That is all is given in the errata description. Seems to assume third=20
one is right value always.

AFAIK it is impacting DRA7 not sure of OMAP5 and OMAP4. Okay I can name=
=20
it on the errata number. Yeah makes sense too. If other versions tend t=
o=20
have this then we can just add this errata feature to them also.

2. Perform third read
(a) If read3 returns Val2 then right value is Val2.
(b) If read3 returns Val3, then right value is Val3.

Which means errata assumes third value is the good value no matter what=
