I would much rather prefer this to the other version as it does not
leave memory hanging around, potentially indefinitely, but ultimately it
is up to Jiri. I only hope that power supply code does not reference
power_supply_desc pointer past unregister (since the device structure
itself may live past the point where power_supply_unregister() returns).

By the way, you do not need name temp, you can do

	kfree(psy_desc->name);
	kfree(psy_desc);

Thanks.
