Just going through things slowly. It's merged in my tree now.

Oh, and a request: _please_ don't use unknown TLA's like OPP. This has
become a huge problem, to the point that we have a
"Documentation/power/opp.txt" file THAT NEVER CLEARLY STATES WHAT THE
F*CK OPP ACTUALLY MEANS! What nice "documentation".

Ok, I can look up things like this and find that it is "Operating
Performance Points". At least in this context. But no, it's not some
kind of generic standard, and no, it's not something people should be
expected to know in general. Please stop doing "explanations" of
things that use TLA's like this. And people shouldn't have to even
wonder.
