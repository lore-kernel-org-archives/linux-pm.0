Devfreq and cpufreq are related to dynamic frequency/voltage switching =
between
pre defined Operating Performance Points or the OPPs. Every OPP being
a voltage/frequency pair. Smartreflex is a different
power management technique.

SmartReflex is a technology that uses adaptive
power supply to achieve the goal of reducing active power consumption.
With SmartReflex, the power supply voltage can be adapted to the silico=
n
performance either statically (for example, adapted to the manufacturin=
g process
of a given device), or dynamically (for example, adapted to the tempera=
ture
induced current performance of the device).

So for every OPP(voltage/frequency pair) depending on the silicon proce=
ss and
temperature the Smartreflex tries to get the voltage to an optimal
value at which
the corresponding frequency can be sustained.
