Then how's this as a compromise. We do not add a TRACE_EVENT_ABI(), but
instead manually add the ABI interface to existing tracepoints. Let's
use the sched example you shown above.

We can connect to the sched_switch() tracepoint manually in something
perhaps called kernel/abi_trace.c or trace_abi.c (whatever).

Here we create the directories manually there:

	/sys/kernel/event/sched/sched_switch/

But this sched_switch will only include the prev and next pids, comms,
and perhaps even run state. But not the prio (since we see that
changing).

It would then need the code to enable the trace point with:

	register_trace_sched_switch(sched_switch_abi_probe, NULL);

Where we have

	static void
	sched_switch_abi_probe(void *ignore,
				struct task_switch *prev,
				struct task_struct *next)
	{
		/* code to grab just the ABI stuff */
	}

And this code can then record to what ever hooked to it.

Making this a manual effort will make it easier to control what becomes
an ABI. We can have long discussions and flames over what goes here. But
that's good since debates before an ABI is created is much better than
debates after one is created.

I'm afraid that a easy macro called TRACE_EVENT_ABI() would have the
same issue. ABIs may be created too quickly before they are thought
through.

Thoughts?
