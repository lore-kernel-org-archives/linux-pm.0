Looks like it's pretty similar to "23 USB Wake on Connect/Disconnect
with Low Speed Devices" in [1].
It points to a workaround in appendix A2 from [2].
However it says this bug only effects Low Speed devices, but it
actually also happens on High Speed devices.

Yes, it's involved.

Clearing those two bits does the trick, thanks for the tip.
