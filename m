If we don't get a notification via ACPI or PCIe hotplug or anything,
then no, it won't be removed automatically.

However, it still can be removed manually via sysfs, can't it?

If there's any kind of notification coming in either before of after the event,
we should act on it and remove the device.  It's a bug if we don't I'd say.
