Well, if it's some ugly #ifdef solution i could imagine light objections on 
pure aesthetic micro-grounds.

You can certainly put in a suspend_blockers.h thing into some Android 
directory, and populate it with empty wrappers - as long as you only use it 
within Android drivers and not core kernel code or other subsystems you dont 
maintain.

It's being done all the time and helpful cleanup patches eliminating the stubs 
are frowned upon (unless the subs are there like for years with no progress 
and no maintenance in sight).

Putting empty stubs into include/linux/ would be pushing things i think.

In fact sometimes architectures even jump the gun with major kernel features: 
we had a dynticks implementation in ARM for years, we had RTLinux stubs in x86 
code for quite some time, and we still have perfmon in IA64 - despite the core 
kernel having gone for a different design.

It's certainly not ideal, but it's certainly a solution that is used every now 
and then. The less difference there is between trees the easier it becomes to 
merge - for both sides, both technically and socially.

That's a well-known problem on lkml: the light at the end of the tunnel was 
the other train ;-)

Anyway, i'm not pessimistic at all: _some_ sort of scheme appears to be 
crystalising out today. Everyone seems to agree now that the main usecases are 
indeed useful and need handling one way or another - the rest is really just 
technological discussions how to achieve the mostly-agreed-upon end goal.

The worst situation are features where one side says 'we dont need this kind 
of functionality at all' - IMO auto/opportunistic-suspend isnt in that 
situation, fortunately.

Thanks,
