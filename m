Well, it looks as if you are thinking about a much more complex solution
than I am...

The proposal we are discussing as

[RFC PATCH 5/5] power: generic-adc-battery: Add capacity handling

just reads the current voltage, charging current and uses a (nonlinear)
mapping to 0% .. 100%.

For that we don't need a library, and we don't need a mechanism to

"write back the capacity percentage and time remaining
to the kernel driver via sysfs or a dev entry.

For remaining capacity I agree that you need that. But this RFC doesn't
even want to provide remaining capacity. To avoid such issues. Just
provide POWER_SUPPLY_PROP_CAPACITY:

https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/8/1/910

So we are discussing to replace these 10 lines with a library, a
daemon and a mechanism that the driver can read that from user space?

IMHO this can be added in a further step, but shouldn't be backpacked
onto this here.

It could also be stored in some i2c eeprom (DT could provide a =
reference).

Oh yes, that is really nice!

Using their terms, we just want to add "Voltage Based SOC Estimation"
for typical "Lithium chemistry".

BTW: this already exists in the twl4030-madc-battery driver and we use =
it
for the GTA04 derivatives without fuel gauge:

=
http://elixir.free-electrons.com/linux/v3.17/source/drivers/power/twl4030_=
madc_battery.c

It uses a table driven approach which was rejected to be converted to DT
some time ago. DT maintainers asked to use an estimation formula instead
of a table and interpolation.

And this patch set does not want to solve all problems in one step :)

But it wants to:
* make it useable for any battery voltage providing iio adc and not only =
twl4030
  by modifying the generic-adc-battery driver
* make the driver device tree compatible (twl4030-madc-battery still =
isn't)
* replace table by fixed point estimation formula fuel_level_LiIon(() as =
requested

Not more.

Of course a libbattery can do a lot of additional calculations to =
predict
e.g. time to emtpy or full charge, estimate battery health etc. and =
provide
more precision by filters.

We would be very happy to have a simple estimation because it already
covers most use cases (some early smartphones had only 4 levels for =
SOC).
And we want to replace the pdata based driver with a DT driver asap.

BR and thanks,
Nikolaus
