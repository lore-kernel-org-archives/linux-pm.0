Thanks for testing.

Bjorn also had the same comment. I think I'll change it to use cut-off
date instead of list of PCI IDs of nobody objects.

PCI drivers typically have left this decision up to the userspace. I'm
wondering whether it is good idea to deviate from that here? Of course
this allows immediate power savings but could potentially cause problems
as well.

I think we need to add corresponding call to pm_runtime_forbid() in
pcie_portdrv_remove().
