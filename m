Okay.

That's not a bad idea.  On the other hand, there must be lots of 
devices which would not be suitable for this.  Disk drives, for 
instance.

What happens if the "inhibit" control is turned on and the driver puts 
the device into runtime suspend, but then an I/O request arrives?

	If the I/O request originated from userspace, it means the
	user is violating the terms of the "inhibit" control.  Should
	the request simply fail?

	What if the I/O request originated from somewhere in the
	kernel, not from the user?

	Or maybe the driver would want to carry out the request,
	overriding the "inhibit" control temporarily.  Does it simply
	turn off the control, meaning that the device won't go back
	into runtime suspend until userspace turns the control on
	again?

	Or if the driver doesn't turn off the "inhibit" control, then
	how does it know when it can safely put the device back into
	runtime suspend?

Qustions like these make me think that this mechanism is best suited 
for a kind of device that doesn't handle I/O requests.  In other words, 
something that just reports events as they occur -- which is another 
way of describing an input device!
