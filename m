I tried but I can't get it working properly because the gdt field is
an array, not a pointer. For example with this_cpu_read(gdt_page.gdt),
I get:

./arch/x86/include/asm/desc.h: In function =E2=80=98get_current_gdt_rw=E2=
=80=99:
./include/linux/percpu-defs.h:308:21: error: incompatible types when
assigning to type =E2=80=98struct desc_struct[16]=E2=80=99 from type =E2=80=
=98struct
desc_struct *=E2=80=99
  case 1: pscr_ret__ =3D stem##1(variable); break;   \
                     ^
I tried different variants without success. What do you think?
