Sigh. No. Forced suspend is a fact of life, and suspend blockers improve 
the ability to support it. It's orthogonal to more general runtime PM.

Drivers should enable wakeups before they disable interrupts. So either 
the packet hits the IRQ handler and the driver takes a suspend block 
(aborting suspend in the process) or it doesn't, the GPE goes high and 
the system resumes immediately after entering S3.

Exactly. So the 5 nanosecond case is already handled. The interesting 
case is where userspace makes the decision to go to sleep and starts 
performing various housekeeping tasks before triggering the suspend. You 
need some way to abort that suspend. The hardware may be long idle by 
then, so you can't just look at the hardware state.
