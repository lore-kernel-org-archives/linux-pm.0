The performance advantage really depends on the benchmark you are running.
It was pointed out this may help some unknown amount with merging pages
in VMs since the pages are now identical and can be merged. The debugging
is also only slightly more difficult. With the non-zero poisoning value
it's easier to see that a crash was caused by triggering the poison vs.
just some random NULL pointer.

As as been pointed out, this help text could use some updating so I'll
clarify this more.

Thanks,
Laura
