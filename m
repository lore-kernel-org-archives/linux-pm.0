However, there's the following scenario (I don't know how realistic it is, though).
It is not related to the cpuidle case, it is related to the case when the device
is woken up by its own IRQ.  Namely, in that case it is perfectly possible that
the IRQ appears exactly when the device is suspending, so if there's a "fast
resume" in the interrupt handler, it will have to wait for the suspend to
complete (or fail).  That in theory may lead to a violation of time constraints
(if there are any).

Well, perhaps that's not a problem.

I wonder if we can do the "fast suspend" and "fast resume" under the
power.lock spinlock.  That would allow us to avoid some complications
related to RPM_RESUMING and RPM_SUSPENDING.  Namely,
if the device is flagged as "power.irq_safe", it will always suspend and
resume "atomically" under its power.lock spinlock.  Then, the status will
always be either RPM_ACTIVE or RPM_SUSPENDED (or RPM_ERROR,
which is uninteresting).  Also, if "fast suspend" doesn't change the device
parent's power.child_count, we won't need to worry about parents any more.

I'm still not sure what to do with _idle() in that case.

Thanks,
Rafael
