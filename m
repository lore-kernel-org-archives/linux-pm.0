And I suppose you picked 5 because 20% is a 'nice' number? whereas
16./666/% is a bit odd?

Well, not quite so, if you want that you should put
____cacheline_aligned on struct uclamp_cpu. Such that the individual
array entries are each aligned, the above only alignes the whole array,
so the second uclamp_cpu is spread over both lines.

But I think this is actually better, since you have to scan both
min/max anyway, and allowing one the straddle a line you have to touch
anyway, allows for using less lines in total.

Consider for example the case where UCLAMP_BUCKETS=8, then each
uclamp_cpu would be 9 words or 72 bytes. If you force align the member,
then you end up with 4 lines, whereas now it would be 3.

Not sure; just mostly asking if this was by design or by accident.

One thing I did wonder though; since bucket[0] is counting the tasks
that are unconstrained and it's bucket value is basically fixed (0 /
1024), can't we abuse that value field to store uclamp_cpu::value ?

OTOH, doing that might make the code really ugly with all them:

  if (!bucket_id)

exceptions all over the place.
