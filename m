I guess it is because PCI PM spec says that the delay needs to be in
both directions. See table 5-6 in PCI PM spec v1.2.

The code in question is in pci_raw_set_power_state():

        /* Mandatory power management transition delays */
        /* see PCI PM 1.1 5.6.1 table 18 */
        if (state == PCI_D3hot || dev->current_state == PCI_D3hot)
                pci_dev_d3_sleep(dev);
        else if (state == PCI_D2 || dev->current_state == PCI_D2)
                udelay(PCI_PM_D2_DELAY);

I agree. We took the 10ms from the original patch but I don't see why we
could not increase it to 100ms or even 500ms.

PCIe spec want to have 100ms delay from when transitioning from D3cold
to D0 and we already do that in __pci_start_power_transition().

In other words we should have all necessary delays for PCIe in place
already. This patch should not be needed.

For decreasing delays we already support ACPI _DSM method. What is
missing is PCIe readines notification support which can be added
separately.

It seems to be pretty recent feature so it might not be supported by the
existing TBT hardware.
