That only concerns the case when you have just turned on the phone and
left it laying around.
You have to admit that it's not the common case for a smartphone. The
common case is that you've played with it for a bit, turning on things
like BT/WIFI, running some apps and so on. And doing so you'll end up
having wake locks taken from everywhere, so I can hardly see a second
of suspend for Nexus.

E. g. when the wireless is connected to an AP, it takes a wake lock
which is released on 15 minutes touchscreen inactivity timeout, as far
as I can tell. So:

* the system will never hit suspend during this period;
* if the download was ongoing and had not been completed during this
period, it will be terminated.

So the bottom line is: the approach is very inflexible. Of course it
can give you the best power savings if you turn the Airplane mode on
as soon as you switched on the phone, but this is not what a typical
user would do.
