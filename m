Hi,

As per the subject, this is to make ACPI-based PCI wakeup (such as WoL on some
systems among other things) work with the "freeze" sleep state.  For this
purpose ACPI wakeup GPEs need to be enabled for wakeup devices before
freeze_enter() is called and it is best to do that when configuring devices
for wakeup.

[1/2] Always enable wakeup GPEs when configuring devices for wakeup
[2/2] Rename one static function to avoid possible future confusion

Thanks!
