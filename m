OK yeah looks like that part is working just fine.

Adding some printks and debugging over ssh, looks like
omap8250_runtime_resume() gets called just fine based on a wakeirq,
but then omap8250_runtime_suspend() runs immediately instead of
waiting for the three second timeout.

Lowering the autosuspend_delay_ms to 2100 ms makes things work again.
Anything higher than 2200 ms seems to somehow time out immediately
now :)

Regards,

Tony
