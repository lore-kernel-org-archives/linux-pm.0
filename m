Well, I don't like this diffstat:

 37 files changed, 183 insertions(+), 56 deletions(-)

which adds a lot of code checking this new vendor. But then it adds in
the AMD paths and I don't see it being any different from an AMD CPU. So
it does the same a Zen does but then it is Hygon.

So I'd prefer to *not* sprinkle those X86_VENDOR_HYGON checks everywhere
but simply have the vendor be X86_VENDOR_AMD and only the user-visible
reporting to show that it is Hygon. Because to the kernel it is an AMD
CPU - only the superficial attributes are something else. Oh well, and
PCI device IDs but that's like another CPU revision.

Thx.
