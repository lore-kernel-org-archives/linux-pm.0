The parent for a musb controller is a "glue" device (e.g. musb_dsps)
which previously was always kept active, but that's no longer the case
as mentioned above.

In a system with two controllers (e.g. a Beagle Bone Black), the host
port may be active and keep the shared clock enabled (managed by the
grandparent device). Thereby the external-abort crash can be avoided
when suspending a disconnected (and runtime suspended) peripheral port.

When the system is later resumed, you would hit that broken activation
code of the runtime suspended device, with a likewise runtime suspended
parent, and the warning would be printed.

Right, this is how things should have been implemented if it is at all
possible too keep the device runtime suspended across system suspend.
