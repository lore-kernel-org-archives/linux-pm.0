So I would like to find a common ground and something you feel
comfortable to ack. The problem I see with your suggested approach
of subclassing struct dev_pm_domain in a struct pci_pm_domain is
that I can easily envision Apple putting some custom methods in the
DSDT to power a non-PCI device up and down. They're starting to use
SPI and UART to attach devices in newer machines.

Hence my suggestion to add a flag to struct dev_pm_domain, even
though at the moment that flag would only be queried by the PCI core.
I don't care if this is called can_power_off or power_manageable or
whatever.

Thanks,

Lukas
