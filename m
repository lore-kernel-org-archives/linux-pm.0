Hi Linus,

Thank you for your review. While I think you're right about the issue
being present in this driver, I'm not sure it's really a problem. Do
we actually require every gpio-controller to also be a stand-alone
interrupt-controller? The binding document for the GPIO module doesn't
mention this - it only requires the gpio-controller property. Without
the "interrupt-controller" property dtc will bail-out if anyone uses
this node as the interrupt parent.

If I'm wrong and we do require it, then I think we need to update
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt.

Best regards,
Bartosz Golaszewski

PS: FYI since this submission I dropped the virtual irq number lookup
in sub-drivers in favor of resources setup by the parent driver[1] as
suggested by Dmitry in his review of the input module driver.
