OK, just as your description, it seems OK.
But this is really a issue as I explained in last email.

So I want to know if there are any side-effect of changing the code
in pci_pm_runtime_xxx()

  if (!pci_dev->driver)
         return 0;
  to

  if (!dev->driver)
         return 0;

I check the code and find out that, the case  dev->driver is
set but pci_dev->driver is not set just in remove state
(__device_release_driver()), and after that state, all be set
to NULL.

My understand is:
dev->driver = NULL, also means unbound,

am I right?

Thanks
Mike
