Hi Tony,

We actually want the deeper state, but not in the price of performance...
So I thought of these possibilities:
1. configure the sleep state to check activity for a longer time than
micro seconds (several seconds). If there is non activity in that long
period, only than will move to retention. I am not sure if there is
such configuration parameter . Maybe one of the following parameters
can be configured for this option ?

46 struct cpuidle_params {
 47         u32 exit_latency;       /* exit_latency = sleep + wake-up
latencies */
 48         u32 target_residency;
 49         u8 valid;               /* validates the C-state */
 50 };

2. Another option can be to write a kernel module which check if there
is ethernet activity for X seconds, if there is none - it will enable
power management , otherwise - it will disable the power management.

These maybe can solve the ethernet issue, but I still not sure why
there is constantly incrementation in the retention state, as if it
enter and leave the state all periodically. Is it becuase some
task/thread/process in the system (I guess it can be a kernel process
actually) ?

Ran
