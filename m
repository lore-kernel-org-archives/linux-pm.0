Thanks

I did reach out to Rob regarding this and the single hardware block
should be described by a single node in DeviceTree.

As such if we split the non-input related handling into another driver
we would need to make the input driver create a subdevice during probe -
or create a new pon-driver with a new compatible that internally spawns
the pwrkey driver. Neither seems desirable to me...


The features of the PON block not yet shown on LKML are status registers
to indicate the reason for powering up the PMIC and a watchdog (which I
don't believe is used or exposed today).
