Hi,

This is a resend of v4, rebased on v4.8-rc4, with dropped two patches:
 * "power_supply: tps65217-charger: Fix NULL deref during property export"
   (already in mainline)
 * "power_supply: tps65217-charger: Add support for IRQs" (queued into
   power-supply's -next branch)

The following patches add tps65217 power button support and make it usable
with am335x boards. It was developed and rebased on v4.8-rc4.

Changes v4 -> v5:
 * Dropped two patches (they were already dropped in v4 resend):
   * "power_supply: tps65217-charger: Fix NULL deref during property export"
     (already in mainline)
   * "power_supply: tps65217-charger: Add support for IRQs" (queued into
     power-supply's -next branch)
 * Combine tps65217 and tps65218 power button drivers (as suggested by Dmitry)
 * Combine device-tree documentation for tps65217 and tps65218 power buttons

Changes v3 -> v4:
 * Add irq_set_parent() during irq init (suggested by Grygorii)
 * Remove hardcoded IRQ trigger type, rely on DT bindings instead
   (suggested by Grygorii)
 * Rebased and tested on top of v4.7-rc4

Changes v2 -> v3 (suggested by Lee):
 * Alphabetical reorder of includes
 * Rename enum tps65217_irqs -> tps65217_irq_type, so we won't confuse
   it with structure object with the same name.
 * Fix inconsistent order of irq_enable and irq_disable
 * Remove redundant 'else' when returning from tps65217_irq_thread

Changes v1 -> v2:
 * Added information about parent device in tps65217 power button
   device-tree binding documentation (suggested by Rob)
 * Rebased and tested on top of v4.7-rc3
