The driver annotations don't need to block the cgroup freezing.  They
just need to keep the system running long enough to awaken a thread
that will handle the wakeup event.  (See below.)  A pm-qos constraint =

is good enough for this.

You can solve this problem if you restructure your "trusted" apps in
the right way.  Require a trusted app to guarantee that whenever it
doesn't hold any suspend blockers, it will do nothing but wait (in a
poll() system call for example) for a wakeup event.  When the event
occurs, it must then activate a suspend blocker.

Better yet, make it more fine-grained.  Instead of trusted apps, have
trusted threads.  Freeze the untrusted threads along with everything
else, and require the trusted threads to satisfy this guarantee.

In this way, while the system is idle no user timers will get renewed.
Kernel timers are another matter, but we should be able to handle them.  =

There's nothing Android-specific about wanting to reduce kernel timer =

wakeups while in a low-power mode.

This is an entirely different matter from the rest of the discussion.
It would be better to consider this separately after Android's current
problems have been addressed.
