I think the current arrangement was that Andreas would ack Thunderbolt
patches and I would merge them via the PCI tree.  That makes some sense
because Thunderbolt and PCIe are related, but the more I think about
it, the less I'm happy with it.

This series is a good example.  I'm sure it's good work and
worthwhile.  But I can't really say anything about the content of it
because most of it is Thunderbolt-specific and there's no public spec.
It seems like this is basically a collection of reverse-engineered
quirks that happen to work with the current state of Linux PM on
certain Macs.  We don't know what might change on future Macs.  We
don't know what might break when we make changes to Linux PM.

I can't test this series, nor do I want to.  I can't test most of the
patches I merge, but I can at least read the spec and see whether the
patches make sense.  What I would *like* is to have public Thunderbolt
specs and a kernel developer's guide so we know what to expect from
the hardware and the firmware and we can write code that should work
not just on current Macs, but also on non-Macs and future Macs.

I don't think the current situation is really maintainable, and I'm
not comfortable merging code that I can't maintain.

I know I don't understand the whole situation, so somebody please tell
me why I'm being unreasonable here.
