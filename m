Ok, I can see the point.  The challenge is how do we expose ABI's and
abstractions that result in drivers and PM implementations that are
somewhat portable between ISA's and platforms?  Simply exporting the low
level knobs of whatever drivers are loaded into memory, if used in user
mode, could result in a tight coupling or even a reverse dependency on a
proper user mode for the kernel to do the right things.

I'm sensitive to becoming blocked on doing kernel a update just because
we can't update the user mode code at the same time.  Its quite
annoying.

IMO to make it easy reuse TI SoC drivers in Intel SoC's (and
visa-versa) I would rather have these low level PM-QoS constraint
details abstracted in some sane and consistent way.  Through subsystem
API's if possible or, at a bus level if we must. 


--mark
Ps I also am worried I'm over thinking about this an Rafael may be right
and we would be better off just exposing the abstractions of "latency"
and "throughput" uniformly and focus more on the missing bus and
subsystem level governors that need to interpret and coordinate the qos
requests.
