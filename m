May I suggest doing something similar with what the scheduler does? I
had some code in the past that reused that code - but basically
duplicated it. If you want, I can try getting a version of that in
kernel/cgroup.c  that would serve as a general walker.

I like that walker a lot, because it happens in a sane order. memcg
basically walks in a random weird order, that makes hierarchical
computation of anything quite hard.

Actually I went with a totally orthogonal solution. I am now using per
kmem-limited ids. Because they are not tied to the cgroup creation
workflow, I can allocate whenever it is more convenient.

I ended up liking this solution because it will do better in scenarios
where most of the memcgs are not kmem limited. So it had an edge here,
and also got rid of the create/post_create problem by breaking the
dependency.

But of course, if cgroups would gain some kind of sane indexing, it
could shift the balance towards reusing it.
