Here it is the usb port device.

At least, there are many boards which have hardwired and self-powered usb
devices, so in theory they can benefits from the power controller.  Maybe
only regulator and clock can't be covered completely for other boards.

The patch can make usb port deal with the 'power controller' only, and make it
avoid to deal with regulators/clocks/... directly.
