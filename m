What about the chip directory ? Shouldn't that be documented? And
shouldn't that mention that this is just for powerpc ?

And before that, I don't think that you are doing this properly. I am
sorry that I never came to a point where I could review it, and you
continued with it, version after version.

But, I really have strong objections to the way this is done. And you
are making things more complex then they are.

So, these stats are per-policy, right ?

Then why aren't they added on the policy->kobj instead, just like
cpufreq-stats? And maybe inside cpufreq-stats folder only?

That will solve many complexities you have in place here and will look
sane as well.

Right now, you have stats as two places, cpu/cpufreq/chip/ and
cpu/cpuX/cpufreq/stats/, which doesn't look wise and adds to
confusion.

What do you say?
