And what would be the user space interface for controlling the power
state of the device?  The documentation doesn't talk about this, and if
we need to make up new ioctls or sysfs files, what do we gain by using
the runtime PM framework?  Especially if there's no uniform (bus- and
system-wide) semantics?

That's application logic.  For example, the user touches the "Lock"
button, then slips the gadget into his pocket.  Then most other buttons
(like volume control) are muted until the device is unlocked again by
some very specific action.  My mobile phone doesn't work like this, it
reacts to each button even when it's locked (though of course does
nothing but says how to unlock it).

Well, I thought runtime PM is intended to have some "common sense"
semantics, so it can be automatic.  After all, it's perfectly reasonable
for somebody else to want the "normal" runtime PM for gpio-keys: to
autosuspend when not in use.  If we stole the callbacks for our purpose,
the "expected" behaviour couldn't be implemented later.  In other words,
the wanted behaviour is not device specific, but usage specific.  And
the runtime suspend behaviour of a device can't be usage specific, it
should match common expectations (to the extent it's possible to talk
about common expectations wrt. runtime PM -- but you may still want to
build one up).  Are these fears unfounded?  Is runtime PM not what I
think it is?
