Affirmative.

The two bugs are related but the fix can be split in two, which I've
just done and sent to the list as v2.

Both v1 and v2 of my fix do not dev_warn() at all on -EPROBE_DEFER since,
as you've correctly stated above, it happens in normal operation.

If you want I could add a dev_info() specifically for the -EPROBE_DEFER
case but personally I don't think it's necessary, it'll probably just
irritate users.

At the end of dpm_complete(), device_unblock_probing() is called and
this will reprobe anything that's ended up on the deferred probing list.
In other words, deferred probing happens right after ->complete has
been called for all devices.

I've amended the commit message of patch [2/2] in v2 to clarify this.

Let me know if you want anything else changed. If you send a pull with
these to Linus, please consider including the thunderbolt double-free
patch posted by Andreas Noever with:

Thank you!
