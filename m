I've applied v6 of this series to my local tree and tested it with
my Thunderbolt runtime pm patches. Everything seems to still work
fine, so my Tested-by is upheld.

I've also compared this version with the previous one in my tree and
reviewed the changes. I only found a punctuation and spacing change
that Bjorn had made and that isn't included in the commit message of
patch [4/5]:

< hotplug event such as BUS_CHECK, we need to make sure it is resumed before

chars now:
