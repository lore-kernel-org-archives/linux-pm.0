You're right.  I should've said re-submitted and merged.  Both have been
submitted (and reviewed) but no follow up submissions after review, and
thus they're still out of tree.

I'm sorry, but this is not perpetual change.  

This driver has been upstream in its current (admittedly
feature-limited) form for a long time, the only thing changing in
$SUBJECT series is the location of the driver.  Why all the fuss about
the missing features now?

> I think you do mean merged upstream in this context.

Correct.

Frameworks always have limitations.  The way they get extended/expanded
etc. is by the submission/review/merging of support for new
features/requirements.  The process for that is the same as any feature
in any part of the kernel.

Evolution, not intelligent design[1].

All of that being said, I'm not sure why this thread was hijacked for
this debate in the first place.  The point of $SUBJECT series is simply
to move and *existing* framework from arch/arm out to drivers.  The only
changes done are cleanups to make this move possible.

I for one would welcome extending this framework to ensure it supports
all the SoC features.  I just don't want those features to be a
prerequisite for this move from arch/arm to drivers.

Please, let's get this moved to drivers, and then add support for the
missing features.

Thanks,

Kevin
