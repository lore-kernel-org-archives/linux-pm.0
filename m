Purely as a matter of interest, in that email Rafael also mentioned
that he and I had discussed a way to disable remote wakeup during 
runtime suspend.  Oddly enough, the method we decided upon was to add 
an "off" option to /sys/.../power/control.  :-)

It would not put the device into runtime suspend immediately, like you
are proposing.  Instead it would mean the same as the "auto" mode,
except that remote wakeup should be disabled during runtime suspend.

We never got around to implementing this, however.
