We can=92t measure at 0 current since the OMAP is driven from battery
and charger and may also draw some mA=85

Yes, and that also depends on the board and battery type. So you always
need to specify some battery specific coefficient for that in the DT.

We simply did choose a table, because calculating the right coefficient=
s
is more complex and getting the table values can easily be done from
running one full charge-discharge-charge cycle.

This is why we have a charging and a discharging table to compensate
for this effect.

We don=92t necessarily know the real battery temperature.

Is a library easier to maintain and handle than just a set of table val=
ues?

Anyways it ends up in a representation of a mapping function with two
input parameters (voltage and charge/discharge indication).

My proposal: keep it simple for everybody. And I can=92t imagine someth=
ing
easier than a mapping table.
