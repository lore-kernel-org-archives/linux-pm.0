A wakeup event is defined as one that wakes the system - if a system 
can't be woken by a specific event then it's impossible to lose it, 
since it wasn't a wakeup event to begin with.

Consider the case where the read() is non-blocking.

Yes, I think you're right here. You need the userspace component as well 
for this to work correctly.

What sets that flag, and how does it interact with an application that 
never makes a blocking system call?

The numbers were earlier in the thread.

Yes, and I'd agree with this if anyone seemed to have any idea how to do 
it right. But despite all the heat and noise in this thread, all we've 
got is an expression that it should be handled by the scheduler (a 
viewpoint I agree with) without any explanation of how to switch 
policies in such a way that applications idle without losing wakeup 
events.
