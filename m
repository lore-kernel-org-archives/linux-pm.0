No need to wait AFAIK :) It seems we can already work on this:

1. Limit the DT clock use to the standard binding as defined in
   the Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt
   until we have a clear plan of the possible additional bindings
   needed

2. Do a minimal drivers/clock/omap driver that remaps the bindings
   to the existing clocks. It seems that Roger already has all
   the code, it just needs to become a proper driver

I can see an issue there if the clocks are board specific, but
what's the clock alias issue with mpu dplls?

Heh I doubt that :)

So the clock-latency is non-standard here, but that's a
separate issue.

Hmm why would the driver need this? Sounds like the driver is
missing support for DT?

The dt_clks[] should be something that's allocated in the
driver/clock/omap driver, let's not stuff that into
cclock44xx_data.c.
