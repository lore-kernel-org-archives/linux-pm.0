No? It's in dd.c, and defer_all_probes is checked in really_probe()
which is part of the normal probe path. The only user currently is in
the power management code, but there's nothing directly power
management related going on here.

It's code that's already used over every suspend and resume. What kind
of breakage are you expecting? How do we test any feature to ensure it
continues to work properly?

It will work for any USB device, but doesn't have the desired
semantics and the implementation is directly tied to USB.

Because the existing feature doesn't allow you to identify what kind
of device has been plugged in, which means it's not usable.

So it won't break the existing USB solution?
