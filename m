If lxc is using it, this will have to stay then.  I'll try to make it
a cpuset specific thing.

Hmmm... I think the root problem is that different controllers don't
agree on the way they inherit configurations from parents.  cgroup
really is a trainwreck.  :(

I don't know whether "needssetup" is the right way to deal with it.
I'll think more about it.

The former.  There was a patchset from Glauber updating ->post_clone()
(which didn't change the behavior).

Thanks.
