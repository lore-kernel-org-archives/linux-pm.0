Exactly.

Deployment of pm_runtime_force_suspend() should generally be done for
children devices first.

If some reason that isn't the case, it's expected that the call to
pm_runtime_set_suspended() invoked from pm_runtime_force_suspend(),
for the parent, should fail and thus abort system suspend.

I will have look and try out the series by using my local "runtime PM
test driver".

I get back to you with an update on this.

Kind regards
