Thanks.

I tried this fix. It seemed to help, however the accuracy of sleep
time for the process was not quite right. A process thread which was
supposed to wake up every (X) seconds, seemed to wake up every (X -
delta X) seconds.

Also another side effect of this change was that the system time was
no longer in sync with the wall time.

These problems were more pronounced when the suspend/wakeup cycle time
was brought down to 0.5 seconds from 4 seconds. The periodicity of
most of the process threads were disturbed.

I decided to NOT suspend/resume the timekeeping subsystem in the
kernel and try. It seemed to work. Every application seems to work
fine.

Now my question is; Is it safe to disable suspend/resume of the
timekeeping subsystem? Will it have an effect (on
functionality/performance) which may not surface in my short
experiments?

Thanks in advance,

Suresh
