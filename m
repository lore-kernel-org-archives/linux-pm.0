D0 may not be a good choice here too.

The problem in this case is the discrepancy between what the platform firmware
tells us and what we know from other sources, so this way or another, something
may be broken.

I guess the safest option is to just keep the current behavior. :-)

Sounds reasonable to me.

No problem.
