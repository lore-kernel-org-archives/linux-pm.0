OK if the WAKE# pin is shared then PCI (or hardware specific?) code needs
to figure out from where it came from.

Well that's why we're just using the existing interrupts-extended
binding there :) It does not leave out the option for shared interrupts,
it's just that drivers/base/power/wakeirq.c can't deal with them in a
sane way or at least we'd have to add a flag to not enable/disable the
wakeirq automatically.
