You are right, commit 877b3729ca0 introduced the issue for you, but it
did that by exposing the same functional problem in the firmware that
was previously addressed by commit 26112ddc254c in a different case.

Yes, it does, thanks!

I have updated the tags and the commit log of this patch according to
