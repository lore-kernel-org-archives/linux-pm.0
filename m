Then you will have to distinguish between -EPROBE_DEFER and other
errors, as I think leaving the device fully powered from a permanent
failed probe isn't very good.

Anyway, for sure it's doable by the driver, but let's try to focus on
the regression here for now.

Then there's a bug in the runtime PM core.

>From Tony's regression report and from mine own local runtime PM test
driver, I can see that the device doesn't get RPM_SUSPENDED (the
->runtime_suspend() callback isn't called), even when the usage count
is zero - when pm_runtime_put_sync() is called.

To find the sequence of runtime PM commands, go ahead an have look in
the omap_hsmmc driver. The problem occurs when the driver bails out in
probe, when it receives -EPROBE_DEFER when fetching regulators.

I have some more data to share on this problem from my runtime PM test
driver. I will try my best to share it tomorrow.

Okay, so you are saying that the pm_runtime_put_sync() should idle the
device even if autosuspend is in use. That seems reasonable, I will
look into this problem.

Kind regards
