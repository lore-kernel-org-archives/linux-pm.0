I'll add the omap list as Cc: to the affected patches directly for now.

Same problem here, though. If there are any ARM specific patches where the arm
mailing list was not copied, that was because the dependency is not listed in
the MAINTAINERS file. As mentioned before, copying the entire series to all
lists touched by one of the patches in the series just doesn't work (and may
be considered severe noise by some subscribers of those lists).
