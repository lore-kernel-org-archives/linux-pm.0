We're all engineers here.   Nobody speaks for the company as a whole without the permission of corporate PR, and that's true for Intel, IBM, and all other companies.

I've seen very hard to debug situations  with Maemo where users are essentially asked to uninstall all their applications, and then install them back one at a time, waiting several hours between each install for a charge/discharge cycle, to figure out which application was waking up the system so !@#@! much while the screen was turned off.   And, when the periodic wakeups are faster than the refresh time of powertop, no, powertop won't help you find the crapplication.   If you think that's acceptable, fine --- we'll see who wins in the marketplace, and who gets blamed for producing a crappy platform --- the incompetent application programmer, or the platform supplier.

Maybe.  And perhaps the right solution in that case is to merge both, as opposed to "consign one to the outer darkness".   And I think that's a decision Linus should make.

I do hope we can come up with a better solution, eventually.  But I do want to point out as a process point of view, we do have other alternates other than "spinning endlessly".
