Would it be possible to detect the ACPI spec version the platform
firmware conforms to, and amend acpi_device_get_power() to return
ACPI_STATE_D3_COLD if the device is in D3?

Then we could avoid the unnecessary runtime resume after direct_complete
also for these older machines.

Can the revision in the FADT (offset 8) be used as a proxy?
=> E.g. the old Clevo B7130 has revision 3 in the FADT and uses
   a _DSM and _PS3 to put the discrete GPU in D3cold:
   https://github.com/Lekensteyn/acpi-stuff/tree/master/dsl/Clevo_B7130
=> Whereas the newer Clevo P651RA has revision 5 in the FADT and uses
   _PR3 to put the discrete GPU in D3cold:
   https://github.com/Lekensteyn/acpi-stuff/tree/master/dsl/Clevo_P651RA

However the FADT revision was already 4 in the ACPI 3.0 spec,
so we can only use it to discern ACPI 2.0 vs 3.0, not 3.0 vs 4.0,
which is what we'd actually want.  And there's a comment in
acpica/tbfadt.c that "The FADT revision value is unreliable."

Do you know of a better way to discern ACPI 3.0 vs 4.0?

No, acpi_device_get_power() can also return ACPI_STATE_UNKNOWN, which has
the value 0xff.  I could add that to state_conv[] above but then I'd have
an array with 256 integers on the stack, most of them 0, which I don't want.
I could check for != ACPI_STATE_UNKNOWN but checking the boundaries seemed
safer. So I maintain that the code is correct.

It would be pointless to add the ->platform_pci_get_power_state
hook without using it anywhere, wouldn't it?

I am adding this here so that I can call pci_update_current_state()
in patch [3/4] to compare the device's state after system sleep with
the one before, and be able to discern D3hot and D3cold properly
(as explained in the commit message above).

That said, I need to amend the patch to remove this portion in
pci_update_current_state():

                if (dev->current_state == PCI_D3cold)
                        return;

because otherwise we'd never try to read the PMCSR if the firmware
says the device is in <= D3hot.

Thanks,

Lukas
