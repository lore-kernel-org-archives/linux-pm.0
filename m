Exactly. The point is, opportunistic suspend doesn't in fact add any
value compared to dynamic PM + CPUIdle. It only produces some false
impression that one can handle power management right without using
dynamic PM. And this false impression is the cause for many really
ugly designs (like, for instance, 15 minutes touchscreen inactivity
delay before forcibly shutting down the wireless, as it's done in
stock Android framework).
