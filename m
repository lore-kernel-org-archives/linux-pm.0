It's possible that this could be a policy decision, ie, whether
power/wakeup is set to enabled for those devices or not.
However, I'd say that there's only one policy that makes sense in that
case : wakeups should be disabled while suspended.

If we inhibited the device during runtime to prevent stray input
events from being generated, it wouldn't make sense to allow the
device to potentially generate an accidental wakeup while suspended.
