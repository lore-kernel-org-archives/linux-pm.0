traditionally, we state the following:
DT will represent actual hardware data.
what we are doing is the following:
DT has virtual clk nodes and kernel contains the actual data.

This is counter intuitive to the original idea of DT containing
hardware data - hence the notion, IMHO, of a hack.

Precisely - thanks for highlighting my view - all the more reason for
us to move clock data out of kernel image :).
$ c_count arch/arm/mach-omap2/cclock*_data.c|tail -1
8110
$ wc -l arch/arm/mach-omap2/cclock*_data.c|tail -1
10310 total

that much code sitting in kernel makes it heavier for us(and others
working on clock framework code) -
we do also foresee that eventually dt data might move out to it's own
repository.

Further, maintaining dts vs kernel code compatibility aside, consider
adding new platforms - more code containing clock data that we have to
carry on in kernel - If we have !

I love the idea that Roger's patch does, as a *step #1* of
transitioning clock data out-of-kernel image and enabling drivers to
entitle DT based boot.

if this is the only step we will ever take, then it will be a
disappointing decision. whether the final data goes to /lib/firmware
or arch/arm/boot/dts - even though, I prefer it in dts, I have no
strong feelings about it.
However, we need to be prepared (at the earliest possible time) to
move that data out of kernel image as *step #2*.
