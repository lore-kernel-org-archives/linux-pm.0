Sorry for the noise, it should not happen.

That is strange, how did you receive this patch? I resent this only to
certain recipients because previous mail got lost in spam filters (too
many recipients).

I did not put other maintainers (like you) this time on cc-list.
git-send-email also did not cc-ed you (your email is not listed in
send-email log).

How this email managed to get to you? :)

Best regards,
Krzysztof
