There are two purposes:

One is to hide the implementation details of the power controller because
the user doesn't care how it is implemented, maybe clock, regulator, gpio
and other platform dependent stuffs involved, so the patch simplify the usage
from the view of users.

Another is that several users may share one power controller, and the
introduced power controller can help users to use it.

Also the power controller is stored as device resource, not any new
stuff added into 'struct device', and all users of the power controller
needn't write code to operate device resource things too.
