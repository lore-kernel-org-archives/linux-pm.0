Not before, but rather after?

printk.h defines default pr_fmt. What you need is to define it before.

Imagine how many drivers could suffer of this. So, something is wrong
either in your code, in headers, or in both. But many drivers for now
are using cusotm pr_fmt() in a way I described.

I understand rationale, here my question: could pcie bridge driver
replace name for the port which serves as thunderbolt?

And you can't do this outside because outside has no knowledge what is
tb_power is. Am I right?
