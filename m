So now we need suspend blocker blockers - as I predicted.

If I have an alarm set on my laptop it will wake up when the alarm goes
off. Once it has woken up it will not go back to suspend (except for
something libe a battery event) until a timeout has elapsed that began
when the laptop woke up.

This in the laptop work solves the problem of making progress. On a
laptop power budget, with laptop constraints on suspend (both physical
cycle limits of hardware and performance) this works fine.

If I suspend/resume my laptop every time I have a 30 second idle gap I
will need a new laptop much sooner than makes me happy.

I don't claim this is true for a typical mobile phone obviously.
