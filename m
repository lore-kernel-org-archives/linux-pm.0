As you said, I can gate all the clocks but only between attempts.
Regularly, I will resume and suspend my controller to perform the card
detection. I don't know if it is a better solution than keeping one
clock enabled and waiting for an interrupt to enable the other ones.

Well I don't agree totally because I have the feeling to use a
workaround because if sdhci_runtime_suspend_host has been called the
controlled is considered as 'disabled' then we won't deal with its IRQs.

I would like to move forward on this issue so it could be a trade-off.

Since the sdhci layer is going to be reworked, maybe it could be
interesting to have another approach of runtime PM to get more
flexibility.
