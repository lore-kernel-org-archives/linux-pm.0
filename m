Ack. thanks for the suggestion. it looks like a good place to me too. 
will do it as part of v2.

was hoping to align on the approach with v2, the follow on OMAP patch
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/183742/ will post with needed changes 
be part of Kevin's thread for OMAP3 if we are ok with it, or Do we want 
to see it in this series as reference?

Agreed. thanks for pointing this out. I have done this as part of v2 of 
my patch. will post in a few hrs.

in OMAP implementation we have need to use these apis from irq_locked 
contexts as well.. lock implementation will prevent thier necessary 
usage. instead we have implemented lock mechanisms in higher layers and 
ensured that the opp table does not change once created - the rest of 
them are query functions - the risk is on opp_enable/disable.

I covered the usage in my reply here: 
http://marc.info/?l=linux-arm-kernel&m=128476570300466&w=2
but to repeat, the list is dynamic during initialization but remains 
static after initialization based on SOC framework implementation - this 
is best implemented with a list (we had started with an original array 
implementation which evolved to the current list implementation
