Platform-wide PM depends heavily on the platform. Instead of adding code to
handle all relevant platforms to all drivers, the generic PM Domain code is
used. The "power-domains" and corresponding PM "clocks" properties may be
added to any device name, depending on the platform.

See drivers/clk/renesas/clk-mstp.c:cpg_mstp_attach_dev(), which registers
the clocks that are used for PM.
If a PM Domain sets the GENPD_FLAG_PM_CLK flag, these clocks are enabled
resp. disabled by the genpd code when the device is resumed resp. suspend.

Doing that means every platform that doesn't want all clocks to be used for
PM need to add custom drivers, while we already handle this in genpd.
Moreover, the same functionality (some clocks are used for PM and/or the
device may be part of a power domain) is needed for non-bus devices, and
thus handled by genpd.

BTW, actually bus drivers are the case that's currently handled special: I'd
rather seen the pm_runtime_*() handling being added to plain simple-bus.
For non-bus drivers, we just add the calls to any driver that may be used on
platforms with clock and/or power domains, but for bus drivers, people wanted
a separate driver (with its own DT binding). Sigh...
