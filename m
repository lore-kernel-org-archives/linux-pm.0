Right, makes sense.

The PME WAKE# pin of Thunderbolt controllers built into Macs is wired
to the southbridge so that it wakes the entire system from sleep.
IIUC for the downstream port to deliver a side-band interrupt to
the root port so that the root port resumes from D3, WAKE# would have
to be wired to the root complex.

In the case of Thunderbolt (as compared to CardBus or whatever),
there's a separate wake pin on the controller which signals such
a side-band interrupt on hotplug, on Macs it's delivered as a GPE.

Okay, maybe I'll just solve this by allowing D3 for all PCIe ports
that belong to a Thunderbolt device if DMI says we're on a Mac.

Best regards,
