True.  Right now the PM core relies on subsystems and drivers to tell 
it when a device is or isn't in use.

Would it make sense to unbind the drivers for these devices when the 
lid is closed?  With the drivers gone, there would naturally be no I/O 
interactions with the hardware and the class devices would disappear.

The respective subsystems could then use their own runtime PM
mechanisms to power down the driverless devices.  (Except for PCI,
unfortunately, which has a policy of leaving driverless devices at full
power.  I was told this is a relic from the days before in-kernel mode
switching for displays was common, when user programs like the X server
would drive displays directly, without using a kernel driver.)
