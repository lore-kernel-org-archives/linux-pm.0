The interface is for specifying PM QoS requirements or constraints that
may or may not be regarded as "parameters", depending on ones definition
of the last term.  Moreover, the code not only implements the interface,
but also defines data structures and API to be used throughout the kernel
which is quite a bit more than just "parameters".

In my not so humble opinion the name isn't good and the .c file should be
in kernel/power in the first place.  I would call it simply qos.c (the fact
that _right_ _now_ it's not a full QoS implementation doesn't matter, because
it may become one in the future).

Thanks,
Rafael
