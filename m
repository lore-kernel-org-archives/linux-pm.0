I disagree that a higher level DVFS interface is unattractive. I think
it has taken a while to get there but people are finally interested in
this. A small amount of discussion about this took place at Linaro
Connect earlier this month (just hallway talk) but we shouldn't rule out
the idea of a general framework for managing DVFS, which frankly is
complex enough to merit not being shoved into the clock layer.

This sounds reasonable but I must point out that the clock framework
today (based on the existing clk.h api) does not have a single instance
of constraint-based logic. For instance there is no clk_set_min_rate or
clk_set_max_rate or clk_set_rate_range. These have been discussed before
but I feel that pushing something before now would have been premature
given that the level of discussion around those features never hit
critical mass.

So the ratio thing is sensible, but it would be the first
constraint-like mechanism in the clock framework so what that looks like
bares careful consideration.

NACK. Let's just model the hardware in the clock framework, please. If
you need to invent fake clocks to represent other constructs then it
means the framework is missing something (or we're missing an entire
framework, e.g. DVFS).
