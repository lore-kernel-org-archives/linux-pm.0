  Merge tag 'pm+acpi-3.12-rc5' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rafael/linux-pm

These fix a bug related to system suspend/resume in intel_pstate and fix it
up after a recent change, make a forgotten structure field change in one of
cpufreq drivers, remove a leftover reference to /proc/acpi/event in Kconfig
help, add a missing mutex unlock to an error code path in ACPI power resources
code and drop a pile of unuseful code related to power resources that causes
problems to happen on real systems.

Specifics:

 - intel_pstate fix for misbehavior after system resume if sysfs
   attributes are set in a specific way before the corresponding
   suspend from Dirk Brandewie.

 - A recent intel_pstate fix has no effect if unsigned long is 32-bit,
   so fix it up to cover that case as well.

 - The s3c64xx cpufreq driver was not updated when the index field of
   struct cpufreq_frequency_table was replaced with driver_data, so
   update it now.  From Charles Keepax.

 - The Kconfig help text for ACPI_BUTTON still refers to /proc/acpi/event
   that has been dropped recently, so modify it to remove that reference.
   From Krzysztof Mazur.

 - A Lan Tianyu's change adds a missing mutex unlock to an error code
   path in acpi_resume_power_resources().

 - Some code related to ACPI power resources, whose very purpose is
   questionable to put it lightly, turns out to cause problems to
   happen during testing on real systems, so remove it completely
   (we may revisit that in the future if there's a compelling enough
   reason).  From yours truly and Aaron Lu.

Thanks!
