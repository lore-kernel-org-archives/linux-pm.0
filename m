With the current kernel and user-space code we run, we get
significantly better battery life on the msm plaform using suspend
compared to entering the same power state from idle. On some devices
it takes only five wakeup events per second to cut the best case
battery life in half.

On the desktop systems I have used I only wake the up the system by
pressing a button/key or with an rtc alarm. Losing a button or key
wakeup event is not usually a problem on a desktop since the user will
press it again. Losing an alarm however could be a problem and this
can be avoided by using opportunistic suspend and suspend blockers.

Because it stops threads that wakeup every second to check if they
have work to do (this includes standard kernel threads), and it
prevents bad apps that never go idle from completely destroying our
battery life.

The system we started with entered a much lower power state from
suspend than idle so we needed wakelocks to get more than 24 hours
battery life. We kept wakelocks when we moved to the msm platform
since it reduces our power consumption.
