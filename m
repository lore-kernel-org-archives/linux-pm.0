You mention you're going to "put it in a single .c file and let the=20
board file include it", I am just wondering where that .c file will=20
live.  It seems it would have to live down drivers/ somewhere so MIPS,=20
x86 etc that might have an SMSC chip onboard can also use it if they wa=
nt.

No the approach with DT is to provide a dummy SoC "board file" with all=
=20
data provided by dtb.  This is already established, see=20
=2E/arch/arm/mach-omap2/board-generic.c for example.  You can see there=
's=20
nothing in it other than minimum dt match business.

People with new boards are getting pointed at that and told to sort it=20
out in dtb and disallowed from creating new board files.

So whatever support or helper scheme you're adding needs a story about=20
how dtb can express it (in dt language, "has bindings for it") or it=20
can't be used on new boards.  That's not a minor ding any more either.

I am talking about, well, "ancestor" pointer only to filter descendant=20
children.  Not for any power control directly.

It gets us away from caring about what the device path looked like prio=
r=20
to that host controller, and since we have confidence it's exactly the=20
host controller we intended by knowing its platform_device, we can=20
ignore everything between than at the right-hand side path fragment=20
identifying the child.  So it's a strong way to reduce fragility on the=
=20
device_path stuff.

DT has lots of bindings now, you can describe regulators and things in=20
there fully.  The point is whatever scheme is workable for this must be=
=20
able to get soaked up using DT too to be acceptable.  Taking the=20
approach you're going to drop literal strings in code in the board file=
,=20
or throw code at the board file at all, will no longer fly.

I have not provided a DT solution for my approach yet either, but I hav=
e=20
taken care that the only footprint in the boardfile version of it are=20
*structs*.  That means translating them to dtb content by adding a=20
binding for the asset stuff for example, will be a clean task.

That's also why back at the beginning of this discussion I gave dts=20
version of the regulator structs I was introducing in that patch... it'=
s=20
proof that the boardfile footprint of that scheme is ready to go into d=
tb.
