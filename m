Thanks for looking into it.

As commented by Jon on internal thread, I am also against the idea of dropping
non-DT support now. Till we migrate to 100 % DT, it is best to keep support
alive. Especial OMAP3 based devices.

Why don't you take phased approach and have both supported for time being.
Then once we move to DT only, we just drop the non-DT support as we plan
to do for many more stuff.

BTW, we are using only CPUFreq driver before this series as well. I guess you
mean the common CPUFReq drivers used by other ARM SOCs.
