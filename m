I don't see it as weird at all. I see the need to define the register
and interrupt resources in DT for SoC peripherals becaue SoCs often
reuse IPs. But in the case of a self-contained i2c PMIC - the modules
such as GPIO are tightly coupled with the core functionality. In the
case of this device for example: there isn't even a separate set of
mask/status registers for GPIO interrupts.

Most mfd devices setup the resources in a hard-coded manner.

Yep, and for that reason I can't use the regmap irq_chip abstraction
for now because it doesn't implement support for hierarchical
interrupts either.

How about the cascaded gpiochip irq_chip?
