Well, we sort of tried this when Greg pulled some of them into the
staging tree.  The problem is that without the annotations, the drivers
are still different, and patches won't apply, so, unsurprisingly, they
didn't get improved or even maintained.

That's also possible.  This time, we would have a cosmetically closer
tree ... however, what's in the kernel wouldn't be compilable for
android ... which is where all the downstream wants to test, so they'd
still be building for the android tree ... we just might have an easier
time of it picking up their fixes.

I think 1 is unviable ... I'm not opposed to 2 but I'd like to try to
get the kernel really closer to android before we go for the cosmetic
only option.

Well, that's why the QoS proposal ... it already has a userspace API ...
we'd just be extending it for statistics, which looks like a wothwhile
goal independent of android anyway.

Right, so the sooner we make it easier for the drivers to use the kernel
as their main repository, the better.
