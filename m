It's an 'architecture bug' in Linux kernel speak: all stuff that is traditionally 
under arch/*. The 'arch' in that directory name derives from 'architecture'.

kernel_power_off() is a traditionally architecture level (not core kernel level 
and not driver level) code.

... and platform code is typically part of arch/ as well.

FYI, you are making an unnecessarily obtuse argument by insisting on the 
architecture != platform triviality and you also injected an uncalled for 
patronizing tone into this discussion by pretending that I don't know that 
distinction. It's sad.

And that is precisely what I meant: in a correctly working kernel, with correctly 
working hardware, in a correctly working universe, the core kernel expects 
kernel_power_off() to never 'fail'.

As the name suggests.

Yes, bugs in user-space, kernel-space, hardware and designed buggy hardware might 
prevent a reboot - as usual.

I.e. I NAK this patch from a core kernel perspective, we don't add such 
workarounds without a lot more information about why it's the right thing to do.

Thanks,
