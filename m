That's only practical on systems where the kernel can be rebuilt.
Moreover, if that affects individual devices, using DMI-based blacklists
is not really practical at all.

I wouldn't call it "fixing the kernel".  I'd rather say "putting workarounds
into the kernel", which I'm not sure is the right thing to at least in some
cases.

However, platform builders may want to fine tuned things and I'm not sure
we should require them to patch the kernel for this purpose.

Root access doesn't necessarily mean you have all of the requisite
tools (like compilers etc.) and installing them isn't always trivial
(think of systems like phones etc.), let alone building the kernel from
sources (where you don't necessarily know the original .config used for
building your device's kernel).

IOW, I don't buy the "you can always rebuild the kernel if necessary"
argument.  It simply is not true in general.

Thanks,
Rafael
