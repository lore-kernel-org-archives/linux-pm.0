So you could use either one.  In my opinion, the 
pm_runtime_dont_use_autosuspend() solution is a little cleaner.

That's one way to look at it.  But in principle you don't need to
suspend the device after an unsuccessful probe.  You can just leave it
at high power.  If this causes problems for a second probe, it's the 
second probe's own fault for assuming the actual state matches the PM 
status.

As Rafael pointed out, pm_runtime_put_sync() has well-documented 
behavior.  It shouldn't be changed.  I don't see how changing the 
behavior would reduce anybody's confusion.  At least, anybody who reads 
the documentation carefully.
