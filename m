Are you opposed to moving _of_get_opp_desc_node from 
drivers/base/power/opp/opp.h to include/linux/pm_opp.h and renaming it 
appropriately?

If I move the ti properties out of the cpu node, as discussed in patch 1 
of this series, and into the operating-points-v2 table, I need a way to 
get the operating-points-v2 device node and I think it makes sense to 
reuse this as it is what the opp framework uses internally to parse the 
phandle to the opp table.

Dave
