You seem to be confusing the ability to go into low-power states with supporting
runtime PM.  The latter by no means requires the former.

Also "cellphone goes to pocket" is really two different cases.  One is when
the user indicated "I'm not going to use the phone going forward" somehow (like
by pressing a screen-off button) and one is when (s)he didn't.

In the second case we really have no reason to discard any input and in the
first one we may as well go straight for runtime suspend (or even for system
suspend for that matter).

Thanks,
Rafael
