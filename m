orderly_poweroff is triggered when a graceful shutdown
of system is desired. This may be used in many critical states of the
kernel such as when subsystems detects conditions such as critical
temperature conditions. However, in certain conditions in system
boot up sequences like those in the middle of driver probes being
initiated, userspace will be unable to power off the system in a clean
manner and leaves the system in a critical state. In cases like these,
the /sbin/poweroff will return success (having forked off to attempt
powering off the system. However, the system overall will fail to
completely poweroff (since other modules will be probed) and the system
is still functional with no userspace (since that would have shut itself
off).

However, there is no clean way of detecting such failure of userspace
powering off the system. In such scenarios, it is necessary for a backup
workqueue to be able to force a shutdown of the system when orderly
shutdown is not successful after a configurable time period.

Changes in v5:

  * Mandated delay for thermal emergency poweroff to be a non-zero value.

Changes in v4:

  * Updated documentation
  * changed emergency_poweroff_func to thermal_emergency_poweroff_func

Changes in v3:

  * Removed unnecessary mutex init.
  * Added WARN messages instead of a simple warning message.
  * Added Documentation.

+
+On an event of critical trip temperature crossing. Thermal framework
+allows the system to shutdown gracefully by calling orderly_poweroff().
+In the event of a failure of orderly_poweroff() to shut down the system
+we are in danger of keeping the system alive at undesirably high
+temperatures. To mitigate this high risk scenario we program a work
+queue to fire after a pre-determined number of seconds to start
+an emergency shutdown of the device using the kernel_power_off()
+function. In case kernel_power_off() fails then finally
+emergency_restart() is called in the worst case.
+
+The delay should be carefully profiled so as to give adequate time for
+orderly_poweroff(). In case of failure of an orderly_poweroff() the
+emergency poweroff kicks in after the delay has elapsed and shuts down
+the system.
+
+If set to 0 emergency poweroff will not be supported. So a carefully
+profiled non-zero positive value is a must for emergerncy poweroff to be
+triggered.
